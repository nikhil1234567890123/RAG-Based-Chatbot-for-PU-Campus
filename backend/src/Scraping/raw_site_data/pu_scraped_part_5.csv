Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

National Cadet Corps
About National Cadet Corps
The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is a Voluntary Organisation, which is administered through the Ministry of Defence. NCC is the largest uniformed youth organization. Its motto is 'Unity and Discipline'. In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation.
In India, The NCC was formed under the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It can be traced back to the ""University Corps"", which was created under the Indian Defense Act 1917, with the objective to make up for the shortage in the Army. The National Cadet Corps is the youth wing of Armed Forces with its Headquarters at New Delhi, Delhi, India. It is open to school and college students on a voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Army, Navy and Air Wing, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens.
Panjab University has taken a lead and started the ""National Cadet Corps Company"" for Boys under the 2nd Chandigarh NCC boys Battalion and for Girls under 1st Chandigarh NCC Girls Battalion.

Research & Development Cell
About Research & Development Cell
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages the promotion of quality research within the Higher Education system. Research and innovation are important aspects to enhance quality education by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Societal challenges of our country can only be addressed by having a strong and vibrant higher education ecosystem with an emphasis on research, innovation, and technology development. The integration of Research, Innovation and Technology Development is the foundation of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India). The establishment of Research and Development Cell (RDC) in Panjab University, Chandigarh is aimed at enabling the attainment of targets of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat and is expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing multidisciplinary/ transdisciplinary and translational research culture mandated in NEP 2020.
Vision
To  put in place a robust mechanism for developing and strengthening the research ecosystem within the University in consonance with the provisions of NEP-2020.
Mission
To create a congenial ecosystem environment for enhanced research productivity.
To promote collaboration across industry, government, community- based organizations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels.
To facilitate greater access to research through optimum utilization and mobilization of existing resources and funding.
Objectives
To build an organizational/ intra-institutional structure with role-based functions of RDC, formulate Research Policy for the University, identify thrust areas of research, and form related cluster groups/ frontline teams/consortia of researchers.
To help the University create Research Policies for recruitment of research personnel, procurement of equipment, and financial management with sufficient autonomy to the Principal Investigator(s) and propagate research outcomes to stakeholders and the public at large.
To put in place policies to promote researchers and innovators, identify potential collaborators from industry, research organizations, academic institutions & other stakeholders for cooperation and synergistic partnerships.
To act as a mediator between researchers & relevant research funding agencies, provide guidance in preparation & submission of project proposals and post-sanctioning of the grants to supervise adherence to timelines.
To create mechanism for coordination among other cells/centers dealing with University-Industry Inter Linkage, Incubation, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions
The establishment of the RDC would facilitate the creation of a research ecosystem for impactful and sustained research output. The essential elements of such an ecosystem, viz., generation of knowledge and facilitation of research, innovation and technology development for industrial & societal benefits, are addressed by human resource (researcher & faculty), intellectual capital (knowledge & skills), governance (regulation & policies) and financial resources (funding & grants).

National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was approved by the MHRD and launched by Honourable Minister of Human Resource Development on 29th September 2015.
This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Department cum Centre for Women's Studies & Development
About Department cum Centre for Women's Studies & Development
The Department-cum-Centre for Women's Studies and Development was originally set up as a Centre for Women's Studies and Development in 1987 with Prof Pam Rajput as its Founding Director. It was one of the first five Centres set up by the University Grants Commission in 1987. On the basis of its excellent performance, it was one of the six Centres placed in Phase III by the UGC. Recently, i.e. in the year 2009, it has been upgraded to the status of a full-fledged Department of the University and is now referred to as Department-cum-Centre for Women's Studies and Development.
The Department seeks both to interpret Women's experiences as well as to change Women's condition, through a transformation of consciousness, social forms and modes of action. It seeks to interrogate the entire system of socio-economic- political and cultural subordination of women as well as influence, reshape and recast dominant ideologies. It visualizes itself as a catalyst to transform an unjust, inegalitarian society into one where gender justice and equality would be the norm.
The Department has been conceived as ""an instrument of social engineering"" in bringing about both academic and social development. It seeks to bring to the University the new scholarship that has emerged from the inquiries into the causes and consequences of inequality and oppression of women and is to serve as a nucleus and a source of ideas, information and inspiration. The aim is to create and maintain a teaching/learning environment for feminist and gender studies, and provide an impetus for sustaining a research community that contributes to the development of women's and gender scholarship within the two-thirds world/Indian context. The trine objectives are to create awareness, to intellectually equip students and to empower all.
Teaching, Training, Research, Extension, Dissemination, and Advocacy are the core activities. It serves as a resource and nodal Centre for the region and true to its mandate, has developed as a strong academic Centre of teaching and learning, generating new thinking and knowledge on feminist theory and initiating courses in women's studies.
The Department-cum- Centre has taken a lead in the region in introducing the formal degree programmes in Women's Studies. The programmes continuing at present are:
M.A. in Women's Studies
Ph.D. Programme in Women's Studies
A few significant aspects of the teaching programme:
The Department-cum- Centre, through its teaching programme not only sensitises the students to gender issues and attempts to ensure a commitment to the empowerment of women, it also provides training in various skills through its curricula. The emphasis is on Practical skill training in Project formulation, designing, monitoring, budget formulation and analysis as well as on research training normally given in Research degree courses such as M.Phil.
Most significantly, the course is multidisciplinary, which stands the students in good stead in any field of activity which they may decide to pursue, viz. development studies, law, human rights or any other.
Where students are concerned, the focus is on quality not on quantity, and the Department-cum- Centre is pleased to report that the students who are graduating from the Department-cum- Centre are indeed thoroughly infused with the fundamentals of women's studies, so much so that they can be likened to candles lighting the path for others.
It must also be pointed out that at least 40 per cent of the students are male.
The alumni of the Department-cum- Centre have all found good placements in various bodies such as the Commonwealth, NGOs, and even the University itself.
There is also a lot of demand for Ph.D in Women's Studies. 14 research scholars are presently enrolled for pursuing Ph.D in Women's Studies. Mention may be made of the fact that out of these 9 are post-graduates in women's studies, while the others come from diverse disciplines. While two are Senior Lecturers in Colleges of Chandigarh, one scholar is from Iran.
Apart from having Ph.D scholars enrolled specifically in Women's Studies, the Department-cum- Centre has also been instrumental in providing guidance to scholars in other Social Science disciplines working on women's issues. As a result, a whole lot of researches have been undertaken which focus on women's issues, with the Centre providing the gender input.

Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture & Archaeology
About Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture & Archaeology
The Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology was established in 1961 with the specific objective of initiating study and research in the field of Ancient India.  The justification of setting up a department distinct from History was that the study of Ancient India required a body of specialized skills with which the department would equip the students. Thus the department offers specialization in the fields of Archaeology, Epigraphy, Paleography, Ancient languages and Numismatics to aid in the reconstruction of India's rich ancient heritage and culture.
The founding of the independent department of AIHC&A sought to carry forward the rich legacy of scholars in this field associated with Panjab University, Lahore in the Pre-partition era  like Aurel Stein and A.C. Woolner  (Vice-Chancellor 1928-1936) who felt the need for establishing a centre for Indological studies.  The setting up of the department of Ancient Indian History, Culture & Archaeology in 1961 was therefore a fruition of a rich legacy going  back to Panjab University's Pre- Independence past.
The department has had many illustrious faculty members since its inception and each one of them through their rich skills enriched India's Ancient past.  Amongst the illustrious luminaries are the great Epigraphist, Numismatist and Sanskritist, Dr. Budha Prakash the founder head of the department who published Political and Social Movements in Ancient Punjab (1964) and other notable books on the ancient history of Punjab and Haryana.  Also associated  with the department was the great Sanskritist, Professor Jagannath Agrawal, the renowned scholar Dr. Amita Ray, Professor S.N. Chopra and Professor Suraj Bhan an archaeologist of international repute who excavated the famous sites  of Mitathal and Sugh.  The other great archaeologist and Epigraphist associated with the department was Professor Bhadur Chand Chabbra who had earlier served as chief Epigraphist and Deputy General of the Archaeological Survey of India.  These noted personalities were followed by many other like Professor V.C. Pandey, Professor G.C.Mohapatra, Shri Devendar Handa, Professor Ashvini  Agrawal, Prof. N.K. Ojha, Dr. Suchi Dyal among many others. At  present the departmental faculty include Professor Renu Thakur and Professor Paru Bal Sidhu, Chairperson, Dept. of Ancient Indian History, Culture & Archaeology.
The department from the past to the present has established itself as a nodal department of the North-Western region for the study of India's ancient past.  It may be pertinent to  mention  here that such a specialized department of Ancient Indian History, Culture  and Archaeology is unique  to Panjab University and that no other University in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh or Jammu & Kashmir has such a specialized department pertaining to the study of Early India.
The department of Ancient Indian History, Culture & Archaeology has made immense contributions to reconstructing the Prehistoric, Protohistoric and Early Historical periods  of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.  The archaeological explorations and excavations form an integral part of the Department's activities from the very beginning. Amongst various sites excavated by the Department mention may be made of Sugh (ancient Srughna) near Jagadhari in Haryana, Mitathal in Dist. Hissar (Haryana), Chandigarh, Singh Bhagwantpur (Dist. Rupnagar), Moharana (Dist. Sangrur) and Pallanpur (Dist. Rupnagar) in Punjab. Each of these excavations has yielded important results and enriched the Department's collection of pottery, coins, seals and sealings, terracottas, sculptures etc. A number of new sites have been explored by the faculty and staff of the Department. The department of AIHC & A has its own Museum in which our housed its antiquities, a large part of which were recovered from  excavations and explorations in Panjab and Haryana.  The department is also one of the nodal departments  which coordinates with governmental bodies of Chandigarh Administration like Government Museum, Sector 10 for acquisition  of antiquities and art works.
At present we have  a large number of Postgraduate Students and Research Scholars enrolled in the department.   The syllabus and course structure of our department is different from that of  History Department.  The mandate and specialization of our department has been reflected in the varied, in-depth specialized International and  National Seminars and Webinars besides special lectures & talks which are organized on a regular basis by the department.

Department of History
About Department of History
The teaching of History at Panjab University during its first three decades of existence (1882-1913) was in its colleges. The university at this time was merely an examining body with its entire library, the Vice Chancellor reported in 1903, occupying just two almirahs. Then in 1913 Ramsay Muir, the modern historian joined as a visiting lecturer to give instruction at the Panjab University to the advanced students from the colleges.
In 1921 the first university professors were appointed as also a Dean University Instruction. In 1925 a much larger Honours school embracing the subjects of English, History, Philosophy and Economics was instituted but this could not take off due to the complexity involved in coordination between the different subjects. Then in 1932 a distinct Honours school in History was begun with Professor J F Bruce at its head. Other subjects, Economics, English, Philosophy and Political Science too set up their separate Honours school which came to be known as 'departments'. Local historical archives were set up under the guidance of the department of History with Mr. H L O Garrett, the Keeper of Panjab Government Records being given the task of collecting and arranging the archives.
The independence of India in 1947 also resulted in the partitioning of the Panjab University. The department of History reassembled after partition at Hoshiarpur. With the construction of the present campus at Chandigarh the department shifted to its present premises in 1956.
Currently the Department of History offers M.A. and M. Phil courses and opportunities for doctoral research. The range of teaching and research includes Ancient, Medieval, Modern and Contemporary Indian History. Given its geographical location most of the research concerns the study of the broad North-Western Region (including the present Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and Pakistan Punjab). Our researches have included inquiries into the polity, economy, society and culture since the earliest times in a pan Indian, integrated and inter-disciplinary perspective. This region is being studied comparatively and in relation to the neighbouring areas within India (i.e. Rajasthan, Utter Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir) and countries outside India (i.e. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia) that interacted closely with North-Western India.
The Department has had an illustrious faculty and many areas of Indian History have been defined by the researches done by them. Professor B.N. Goswamy charted his own course in Indian art history and raised it to a new height. Professor Ravinder Kumar gave a new meaning to Modern Indian and Contemporary History. Professor Hari Ram Gupta pioneered nationalist historiography on the Sikhs. Professor J.S. Grewal produced seminal studies in Historiography, Urban History, Sikh History and the Punjab as did Professor Indu Banga. Professor Parshotam Mehra unraveled the threads of India's connection with Central Asia. Professor Kamlesh Mohan is well known for her interventions in feminist and cultural history. Professors S S Bal, J S Grewal and Ravinder Kumar also occupied important administrative positions in Higher Education each leaving his own foot print onto the practice of history in India.
The researchers and faculty associated with the department have over the years published more than 90 books/monographs and over 550 research papers. They have pioneered research in some uncharted areas. The faculty and students have been active in providing inputs to the print as well as audio visual media.
The Department has organized from time to time more than 60 International and National Seminars, Conferences, Refresher Courses and Workshops. The products of the Department have made their mark also in other walks of life, including the civil services, military, media and the legal profession.
The MA programme of the department is spread over 4 semesters involving 96 credits; the study of the history of Punjab is compulsory. Students of the department are allowed to take up courses in other departments of the university and students of other departments are welcome to take courses offered by the department.

Department of Philosophy
About Department of Philosophy
Department of philosophy, Panjab University, Chandigarh has been providing a university base in the City beautiful to the cultural, social and religious heritage of Indian civilization to humanize and enrich the modern notion of .progress. and to enable it to promote, rather than to supplant, Indian cultural and philosophical identity. To respond to the challenges of our global times, the department has initiated the need for a process of convergent research. This has come from the faculty as they generate a philosophical insight in facing the deepest human aspirations and problems. Accordingly, the department has been successfully organizing national and regional seminars pertaining to community values, intercultural cooperation, and the philosophy of consciousness during the past years. In sum, the achievements of the philosophy department can be summed up under three headlines:
Epistemology: Ways of thinking
Modern philosophy was initiated in a rupture from earlier thought. This created an empty space reserved exclusively for clear and distinct ideas. These were joined in the rigorously deductive process of objective thinking essential to science. Hence, keeping in view of the ways of thinking, the department conducted various seminars, symposia and conferences on epistemological issues.
Ethics and Social Philosophy
The development of social life in our times expands the agenda of ethics, which Aristotle situated within politics. It points to the importance of personal probity and commitment to the values of justice and equality. Hence, a major challenge for ethics for public life today is to change the image of public administration from the horizon of personal enrichment to that of public service. This requires re-conceiving the relation of the person to society; at base it is the fundamental ethical issue of transcending egoism.
Aesthetics and Religion
The aesthetic and religious aspects provide the integrating synthetic categories for situating each diverse element within a whole that is humane and humanizing which can respect freedom and unite its results in a work of beauty as well as inspire competition with congruence and find the proper role for diversity within the global whole. Accordingly, the faculty in the department has produced articles of international repute in the fields of aesthetics and philosophy of religion, which were published in national and international journals of repute.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was approved by the MHRD and launched by Honourable Minister of Human Resource Development on 29th September 2015.
This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Panjab University Oral History Project
Panjab University Oral History Project
Panjab University Oral History Project
OHP Administrator
2016-10-01T20:41:20+05:30
Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

Its motto is 'Unity and Discipline'. In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation.
In India, The NCC was formed under the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It can be traced back to the ""University Corps"", which was created under the Indian Defense Act 1917, with the objective to make up for the shortage in the Army. The National Cadet Corps is the youth wing of Armed Forces with its Headquarters at New Delhi, Delhi, India. It is open to school and college students on a voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Army, Navy and Air Wing, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens.

Further, it aims at creating a pool of organized, trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities in all walks of life, who will serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless to say, the NCC also provides an environment conducive to motivating young Indians to join the armed forces.

To Provide a Suitable Environment to Motivate the Youth to Take Up a Career in the Armed Forces.

Research & Development Cell
About Research & Development Cell
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages the promotion of quality research within the Higher Education system. Research and innovation are important aspects to enhance quality education by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Societal challenges of our country can only be addressed by having a strong and vibrant higher education ecosystem with an emphasis on research, innovation, and technology development. The integration of Research, Innovation and Technology Development is the foundation of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India). The establishment of Research and Development Cell (RDC) in Panjab University, Chandigarh is aimed at enabling the attainment of targets of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat and is expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing multidisciplinary/ transdisciplinary and translational research culture mandated in NEP 2020.
Vision
To  put in place a robust mechanism for developing and strengthening the research ecosystem within the University in consonance with the provisions of NEP-2020.
Mission
To create a congenial ecosystem environment for enhanced research productivity.
To promote collaboration across industry, government, community- based organizations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels.
To facilitate greater access to research through optimum utilization and mobilization of existing resources and funding.
Objectives
To build an organizational/ intra-institutional structure with role-based functions of RDC, formulate Research Policy for the University, identify thrust areas of research, and form related cluster groups/ frontline teams/consortia of researchers.
To help the University create Research Policies for recruitment of research personnel, procurement of equipment, and financial management with sufficient autonomy to the Principal Investigator(s) and propagate research outcomes to stakeholders and the public at large.
To put in place policies to promote researchers and innovators, identify potential collaborators from industry, research organizations, academic institutions & other stakeholders for cooperation and synergistic partnerships.
To act as a mediator between researchers & relevant research funding agencies, provide guidance in preparation & submission of project proposals and post-sanctioning of the grants to supervise adherence to timelines.
To create mechanism for coordination among other cells/centers dealing with University-Industry Inter Linkage, Incubation, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions
The establishment of the RDC would facilitate the creation of a research ecosystem for impactful and sustained research output. The essential elements of such an ecosystem, viz., generation of knowledge and facilitation of research, innovation and technology development for industrial & societal benefits, are addressed by human resource (researcher & faculty), intellectual capital (knowledge & skills), governance (regulation & policies) and financial resources (funding & grants).

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Panjab University Oral History Project

Panjab University Oral History Project
OHP Administrator
2016-10-01T20:41:20+05:30
Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.
