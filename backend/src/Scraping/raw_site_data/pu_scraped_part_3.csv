Quality Assurance initiatives taken by MIS/IQAC
Enrollment Data
Enrollment data is collected from depts/colleges every year by the Statistical Cell of DR Colleges. In the absence of IT support/resources and proper controls, it was difficult for them to ensure the quality. MIS/IQAC Cell took initiatives to compile the Master List of courses (year-wise) from Handbook of Information and other sources. It was ensured that all faculties, all departments, and all courses are included. Steps have been taken by MIS/IQAC Cell to improve the quality of data to ensure completeness and correctness of data
Examination Data
Earlier, during data compilation for various surveys, data collected from various sources (e.g. manual results, computerized results, departmental results etc) would be summed up and sent. In the absence of any common list of courses it was difficult to ensure whether data about all the courses have been included. The format for data collection was prepared with pre-filled courses, and DR (Exams) was requested to send the data in that format. The pre-filled data saved their time too, and at the same time ensured completeness of data and verification of courses at the same time.
Researchers Data
Data about Researchers is collected at various sources like R&S Branch, General Branch, Secrecy Branch, Thesis Section etc. Meetings were held with the concerned dealings, format of data studied, problems and communication gaps were identified. MIS/IQAC took the source data (in MS Word format) from R&S Branch and converted it into MS Excel format for data analysis and has identified the data flow from enrollment till award of degree. The various result notifications (of syndicate) about award of PhD are in MS-Word format and contain useful information about researchers. Efforts are on to streamline the process in this direction and to get quality data/information about research statistics.
International Students Data
Data storage and collection procedures have been refined to cater various national and international surveys. The information layout has been useful for internal purpose as well. Templates have been designed to collect data about various other activities like International Students data/MoUs signed by PU etc.

Vice Chancellor
Professor Renu Vig
Vice Chancellor Panjab University
Professor (Dr.) Renu Vig is discharging the responsibilities of Vice-Chancellor of Panjab University since Jan 16, 2023. Prior to this, she has held several key positions at Panjab University-Dean University Instruction, Dean Research, Dean Faculty of Engineering & Technology, and Director UIET. With a teaching and research experience of more than 35 years, Professor Renu Vig holds a Ph.D. in Engineering and Technology in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.
She has a stellar academic record having been awarded Gold Medal by Panjab University for standing first in B.E. across all departments in Punjab Engineering College and other affiliated colleges, and Roll of Honour for standing third in Pre-Engineering, Panjab University. In addition to academics and research, the exemplary contribution she made during sabbatical project undertaken at Infosys Technologies Ltd earned her appreciation letter from Dr. M.P. Ravindra, Vice President and Head, Education & Research Dept., Infosys Technologies Ltd.
She has guided 10 PhD successfully in the area of Signal Processing and Fuzzy Logic based control. She has more than 100 SCI/Scopus indexed reputed research publications to her credit. She has visited prestigious institutions such as University of Cambridge, University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham and National University of Singapore. She has presented paper in World Congress on Engineering at Imperial College London.
Professor Renu Vig has significant experience of conceiving projects for arranging grants from various agencies. Under her leadership, UIET received Rs. 10 crore grant under TEQIP-II project of MHRD for sub Component 1.1 i.e. Strengthening Institutions to improve Learning outcomes and Employability of Graduates. UIET was selected as a well performing institute, and additional Grant of Rs. 5 crore was sanctioned by MHRD. She successfully set up Design Innovation Centre funded by MHRD at Panjab University. This project was worth Rs. 10 Crore and initiatives are being taken to promote design and innovation culture among students and faculty.
Professor Renu Vig is Principal Investigator of
Project
'Robust Automatic Segregation of Defective Fasteners in Industries using Deep Learning' executed in
collaboration with Nottingham Trent University
. The objective of the project was to design an autonomous system using deep learning techniques for the efficient classification of defective and non-defective fasteners in small and medium-scale industries, aiming to replace traditional manual methods that are often time-consuming and inefficient. The process begins with the collection of a diverse dataset of fastener images under consistent conditions, followed by preprocessing steps such as labelling, resizing, and augmentation to prepare the data for training. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then developed and trained to accurately classify the fasteners based on visual defects. Once the model is validated, it is integrated with an embedded system equipped with a camera for real-time image capture and analysis.
Professor Renu Vig is the Inventor for patent entitled 'Distress Signal Based Criminal Activity Detecting, Preventing and Reporting Device, System and Method' and Panjab University is the patentee. This intelligent system is capable of detecting distress voices or panic screams automatically without the need of a specific trigger word or manual activation. Upon detecting a distress signal, the device can immediately alert the nearest police station and sound an ultrasonic alarm at the location to confuse the attacker.
Professor Renu Vig has spearheaded several key initiatives in Panjab University dealing with various crucial aspects as given below.
NAAC Accreditation
:
She played a pivotal role in securing the prestigious NAAC A++ grade with a score of 3.68, the highest in the university's history. Under her leadership, the university implemented strategic improvements across all seven NAAC assessment parameters, including curricular enhancements, research innovation, and infrastructure upgrades. She ensured meticulous preparation for the NAAC peer team visit, with mock drills, campus revamps, and a comprehensive Self-Study Report (SSR).
Her collaborative approach—engaging faculty, staff, and stakeholders—and her focus on addressing past NAAC feedback were instrumental in this achievement, elevating Panjab University to India's elite institutions.
National Education Policy (NEP) Implementation
:
Panjab University initiated NEP implementation in the academic session 2023-24, and affiliated colleges in session 2024-25. A wide array of Skill Enhancement Courses (100 new courses) and Value Added Courses (approximately 75 courses) are now available. The first NEP batch will graduate from Panjab University in 2027 and from affiliated colleges in 2028. By July 2027, Panjab University must be prepared to offer a one-year Master's Program for students who have graduated with 4-year Honors/Research Degrees.
Strengthening Entrepreneurial Culture
:
The entrepreneurial culture is being strengthened by the Panjab University Incubation Centre. Skill-oriented courses are regularly organized by the Centre for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Currently, PU has more than 50 successful startups, and this ecosystem will be further strengthened through initiatives like Idea Hackathons, pitching for funds in presence of investors, industry and academia meets etc.
The S&T cluster, in collaboration with IIT Ropar through the Section 8 company PI-RAHI (
Panjab University, IIT Ropar - Regional Accelerator for Holistic Innovations
), has become operational. Efforts are being made to develop technologies and subsequently commercialize them in various areas such as medical devices, green energy, AI and Machine Learning, waste management, healthcare, agriculture etc. Institutions and organizations in the northern region are being encouraged to find solutions for industry and society.
Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security
:
The establishment of a Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Cyber Security, in collaboration with the Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC), an international cyber security non-profit foundation, is envisaged. An MoU has already been signed with ISAC for capacity building in Cyber Security.
Digital Transformation through e-SAMARTH Deployment
:
Under her visionary leadership, Panjab University has adopted the e-SAMARTH ERP system, a cloud-based platform launched by the Ministry of Education under the National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT). This initiative aims to consolidate fragmented data across colleges/departments into a unified digital framework, enhancing transparency and efficiency.

About Research & Development Cell
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages the promotion of quality research within the Higher Education system. Research and innovation are important aspects to enhance quality education by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Societal challenges of our country can only be addressed by having a strong and vibrant higher education ecosystem with an emphasis on research, innovation, and technology development. The integration of Research, Innovation and Technology Development is the foundation of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India). The establishment of Research and Development Cell (RDC) in Panjab University, Chandigarh is aimed at enabling the attainment of targets of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat and is expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing multidisciplinary/ transdisciplinary and translational research culture mandated in NEP 2020.
Vision
To  put in place a robust mechanism for developing and strengthening the research ecosystem within the University in consonance with the provisions of NEP-2020.
Mission
To create a congenial ecosystem environment for enhanced research productivity.
To promote collaboration across industry, government, community- based organizations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels.
To facilitate greater access to research through optimum utilization and mobilization of existing resources and funding.
Objectives
To build an organizational/ intra-institutional structure with role-based functions of RDC, formulate Research Policy for the University, identify thrust areas of research, and form related cluster groups/ frontline teams/consortia of researchers.
To help the University create Research Policies for recruitment of research personnel, procurement of equipment, and financial management with sufficient autonomy to the Principal Investigator(s) and propagate research outcomes to stakeholders and the public at large.
To put in place policies to promote researchers and innovators, identify potential collaborators from industry, research organizations, academic institutions & other stakeholders for cooperation and synergistic partnerships.
To act as a mediator between researchers & relevant research funding agencies, provide guidance in preparation & submission of project proposals and post-sanctioning of the grants to supervise adherence to timelines.
To create mechanism for coordination among other cells/centers dealing with University-Industry Inter Linkage, Incubation, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions
The establishment of the RDC would facilitate the creation of a research ecosystem for impactful and sustained research output. The essential elements of such an ecosystem, viz., generation of knowledge and facilitation of research, innovation and technology development for industrial & societal benefits, are addressed by human resource (researcher & faculty), intellectual capital (knowledge & skills), governance (regulation & policies) and financial resources (funding & grants).

1.3.1 Institution integrates crosscutting issues relevant to Professional Ethics ,Gender, Human Values ,Environment and Sustainability into the Curriculum
To integrate cutting-edge policy, curricula across the board are revamped annually. All courses are so designed to impart ethical orientation. Foundation courses include those on
environmental protection and sustainability
. Department of Environmental Science, Panjab University is working as an interdisciplinary center to learn and disseminate knowledge in various aspects of the environment. A course on environmental sciences is compulsory for undergraduate students that sensitize them about their responsibilities towards mother earth and suggest scientific ways to reduce e-waste and adopt the principle of reuse, reduce, and recycle. There is a separate department for the Environment studies
The students, teachers and staff are sensitized to the human values and
ethical dimensions
through the organization of workshops and commemorative events. The various stakeholders are involved through institutional committees to ensure consistent, equitable and equal actions in all fields. The human resource and development centre (HRDC) conducts a faculty development program on gender biasing, ethics in professional life, human values and other such relevant topics at regular intervals.
The Ethics Review Committee meets regularly to address
any ethics-related
issue in the submitted/ongoing research proposal. There is no glass ceiling anywhere in the institution in terms of gender. There is a centre of women’s studies and development in the university that was established in 1987, it seeks both to interpret women’s experiences as well as to change their condition through a transformation of consequences, social forms and modes of action. It is working tirelessly to achieve the objective of socio, economic, and political justice and equality for women from all spheres of society. Humanities courses such as English and Cultural Studies carry a component of
Eco-criticism
.
Regular tutorials and mentorship ensure the maintenance of human values among students. Most of the university events are marked by some sustainable act such as tree plantation, the dissemination of water
conservation consciousness or a brief clean-up operation of the surroundings, or gifting of plant saplings. A full course on
Green Chemistry
is an integral part of the
curriculum at the UG and PG levels
that fulfills the objective of teaching them the efficient usage of renewable raw materials, eliminating waste and avoiding the use of toxic and hazardous reagents in the manufacture of chemical products. The efforts of the faculty to adopt clean and green approaches in their research endeavors are evident from their publications in the reputed international journals devoted to the cause such as Green Chemistry, Environmental Science and Technology, Journal of CO2 Utilization etc. The Centre for industry-institute partnership program is a separate entity for the self-sustaining centre on the strategic business unit concept to bridge the gap between theory and practice and to sensitize the university towards industry needs.
The
Equal Opportunity Cell -PWD
monitor and evaluate continuously the reservation policies of the states, and central government in consensus with the UGC regulation. The university is highly sensitive to the needs of differently-abled faculty, staff, and students, each parking lot in the campus has space allocated for the PWD, and wheelchairs have been provided in every department/hostel/office. Gender fluidity is respected; this institution is among the first few to provide dedicated transgender washrooms. Professional ethics is also being taught across all courses of university like
Department of environment studies , Centre for Human Rights & Duties
and department of public administration.

2.2.1 The institution assesses the learning levels of the students and organises special Programmes for advanced learners and slow learners
The parameter of equality is deeply embedded within the teaching-learning ecosystem of Panjab University. We endeavor to ensure that each student who enrolls in our programmes achieves her/his full potential. We focus on exposing the students to the state-of-the-art both in terms of knowledge levels and competitive environments so that we can produce ethically discerning and professionally competent individuals who come to learn and go to serve.
At the same time, we also realize that not all students enjoy an equal level of learning and imbibing felicity. Many times the unequal learning capacities and abilities of the student are a factor of the diverse socio-cultural, economic, regional and ethnic backgrounds of the students. We at Panjab University enroll students from all parts of India and sometimes even from other countries. Some of these students have had
their basic education with English as the medium of instruction while others have been educated in the vernacular medium. That is perhaps the first level of disparity in terms of learning abilities. This disparity, Panjab University has countered by allowing students to write their exams in any of the three languages: English, Punjabi and Hindi. Answer scripts are sent to evaluators well-versed in the language. This apart the University offers a number of special courses for developing writing skills. Soft skills modules that focus on developing a greater felicity in the use of the English language are also offered from time to time.
Another important hallmark of the Instruction System of Panjab University is the Honors School System. The Honors school system completed 100 years of its existence in 2019. An integrated five-year programme offering BSc (Honors) as well as an MSc (Honors), it is a programme that caters to the abilities of the more advanced learners. As against the B.Sc/B.A. (Pass Course) Programme which is oriented towards relatively slow learners, the Honors School Programme allows students with advanced learning abilities to achieve higher levels of academic excellence.
All departments of the University run the Mentor-mentee programme which allows students to share their individual experiences as well as challenges within the teaching-learning system with their teacher mentors.. Remedial lessons are imparted during the Tutorials held once a week for every course. Slow learners are also encouraged to learn using self-learning materials, e-resources and bridge courses. Even during classroom interaction, teachers take care that their lecture is understood by the slow learner and appreciated by the advanced learner, whereas for bright students’ mentors/teachers provide reference and advance books/ e-books/ journals etc, exposure to new tools/software, encouraged to take additional R& D projects. Panjab University runs an exclusive Centre for IAS and Other Competitive Examinations, Centre for Industry Institute Partnership Programme (CIIPP), Technology Enabling Centre (TEC) of Panjab University is a project sponsored by Department of Science & Technology (DST) to help aspirants in various fields and provide a platform to network researchers with other institutes, National laboratories and industry. The main focus of the university is to provide an enabling eco system, process and support system.

2.3.1 Student centric methods, such as experiential learning, participative learning and problem solving methodologies are used for enhancing learning experiences
The student-centric curriculum followed by Panjab University enables the student as a problem solver to broaden their mental horizon and increase their knowledge base so that they become conceptually clear and able to apply that knowledge for the solution of their own as well as social, and technical problems and to
covers the teaching-learning gaps.
The Panjab University curriculums are structured in such a way that each concept starts with a problem description, and students put theory into practice by applying critical methods of experiential and participative learning. Each course ensures the active participation of students. The university has adopted various hands-on student-centric methodologies. Across programmes at Panjab University, diverse strategies are used to enhance the learning experience of students. Even within the conventional lecture format, an attempt is made to use the free associative technique which helps to integrate inputs and experiences with discussions, interactions and dialogue.
Experiential Learning:
The Lab work is designed/assigned in such a way that each student has been given an opportunity for experiential learning in the maximum departments which is also assessed one way or the other.
Presentations by the students are required in each of the courses and the same is also the parts of marks to be awarded for internal assessment.
Field trips / school visits/ Industrial visits/ Institutional visits are organized for students by all the departments to give an exposure to learning beyond the scope of classroom/laboratory training .
Internships/ community awareness is integrated into the programme structure of both UG and PG programmes and they are part of the assessment also, wherever applicable
Poster presentations, Quiz/ paper presentations and Model Making are regular activities organized for students by all the departments.
PhD students are assigned classes, normally less than 5 hours per week, which enhance their experiential learning
Participative learning
Case Study/ project work analysis is a regular student-centric method adopted to enable education, sociology, social work, Management students, community education, disability studies etc. to analyse trends in education, society, and community to prepare models for the future. The learning outcomes of these activities are discussed and shared with the entire class.
Through group discussions/seminars also, the students learn in a participative manner. Students are got involved in the organization of seminars/workshops/conferences and various other programmes.
There is the provision of involving the students in various bodies including the Court, the Academic Council, YRC, NSS and the Quality Advisory Council of the University through which the participative learning of the students is enriched.
Short Film Making, play, drama, theatre, newspaper development, musical compositions etc. helps students of Mass Communication, the department of the Indian theatre department of music, language department to express their creativity in visualization, documentation framing and concept creation in an effective manner
Problem-solving methodologies
Along with classroom teaching and laboratory- experiment-based learning, students are involved in research projects in the field which helps and enhance their real-life problem-solving abilities.
Assignments are given so that students enhance their hands-on experience in problem-solving.
Quiz contests and snap tests are also conducted from time to time to keep the students in a competitive environment and to check the overall progress of the class.

2.3.4 Development of Self - Learning Material (SLM) at DDE Process followed for development of Self - Learning Material by DDE
Process followed for development of Self-Learning Material
The process of development of Self Learning Mode is initiated with finalization of the UG,PG, Diploma and Certificate courses syllabi by the statutory bodies of the university
The department identifies the outside experts based on their specialization. Experts and the faculty members of the department are allotted the themes for developing our lessons.
All these prospective writers are invited for training workshops which help in initiating them into the processes and demands of the work to be done.
Many workshops were organized by USOL where ODL experts from reputed national institutes interacted with faculty members. During these workshops, the standardized structure of SLM was developed which essentialized that the lessons should be self explanatory, self-contained, illustrative, easily comprehensible and in manageable modules such as units and blocks.
Subsequently, the text development of the lessons is done as per the norms decided upon. It is followed by review of the lessons developed by subject experts.
Vetting of the lessons is done by a different set of experts. These are further subjected to the third party academic audit by the committees of the faculty members drawn from within and outside the department.
After their approval, the draft is presented before Centre of Internal Quality Assurance for approval.
The lesson production committee of the department takes care of the printing of the lessons for dissemination.
In whole of the process, the feedback of the previous year students remain central for consideration so as to limit the problems in the lessons to the minimum in future.

The Program Syllabi, USOL Prospectus, and Academic Calendar (all materials are available on the USOL/Panjab University website) specifically define the scheme of continuous (internal) assessment for each and every program. Accordingly, students have to work and submit it by the specified time. In case, students can not submit the same due to some reasons, they are given another chance. The scores obtained by students in internal assessment is displayed on e-notice board of USOL. In case, students feel any discrepancy, they are free to ask about it from their evaluators and their doubts and discrepancy are cleared out. Transparency is kept for internal assessment. Students are free to ask about these.
After this, final assessment scores are submitted to the examination branch of Panjab University. The internal awards are uploaded on the local network of Examination branch of Panjab University or sent to this branch through official channel in print form.

2.6.2 Attainment of Programme outcomes, Programme specific outcomes and course outcomes are evaluated by the institution
The course outcomes are assessed using multiple strategies appropriate to various learning objectives. Theoretical gains are tested at regular intervals using snap tests, mid-semester and end-semester examination. Additionally, discussions, presentations and term paper assignments are reliable, time-tested tools to assess learning outcomes. Many Departments also have self-assessment by students. At the beginning of each lesson, expected learning outcomes are specified and in between there are selfassessment questions/ activities designed to test expected learning outcomes. As the student progress through the lesson, they assess their learning by attempting self-assessment questions/ activities. This is most effective for self-motivation and learning. Further details about different assessment methods are as follows:
Mid-Term examination:
Mid-Term examinations (Minor-1 and Minor-2 examinations) are a part of Internal Assessment. Each Mid-Term examination carries a weightage allocated for concerned Theory subject.
Assignments and Quizzes:
Assignments and Quizzes are also a part of Internal Assessment and carry a weightage in total marks allocated for concerned Theory subject. Nature of assignments may involve different types of tasks such as discussion, presentations, etc. Besides, tutorials, class room discussions and seminar papers also play an important role in assessing students. In some of the department’s projects and practical work also help to assess course outcomes in some specific courses.
End-Term Examination:
End-Term Examination (Also known as University Examination) is conducted once per course. Question paper for such exam is set by paper-setters proposed by the concerned Board of Studies which is composed of subject experts from among Panjab University departmental faculty, faculty from regional centres, faculty from constituent colleges, industry personnel. Students are given flexibility to Re-appear in any course exam if they are not able to clear it in first attempt.
Practical Assessment:
Most of the Theory subjects have a Practical, that is evaluated on a continuous basis. Practical files are also used in the evaluation process. Overall assessment is based on practical performance of the students in the laboratory, number of experiments performed, practical viva-voce, written report/record of the experiments and regularity (attendance) in the class.
Project Work Assessment:
Students are motivated to develop good projects whose evaluation is done jointly by departmental project committee, concerned supervisor/s and external experts. Students are asked to present their work through oral presentations and showcase their designed products etc. during such evaluations.
Internships Assessment
: Students are encouraged to take up internships, projects, fieldworks preferably at industries. Assessment is jointly done by the Industrial Supervisors and Departmental Faculty members on project basis. Mid-term viva and final viva-voce is also conducted for such evaluations.
Competitive Events:
Events like employability tests, debates and discussions, mock-tests, creative writing competitions, start-up idea competitions, cultural competitions etc. are conducted to assess the quality of skills attained by the students. Start-up cell also organizes start-up competitions and encourages students to initiate and incubate their start-up ideas at institute level.
Others:
Skill developments tests including hands-on working, case studies, mooc courts, field visits and field-work based practical classes are utilized in assessing the students’ performance under real life scenarios. Student awareness seminars, counselling sessions are organized to ensure the attainment of some course outcomes.

The technological explosion has drastically transformed the distance education as a system. Moving in time with technological advancement,
University School of Open Learning (USOL) makes sincere efforts to counsel its distant learners through the use of various media.
USOL uses Panjab University Community Radio Station, Jyotirgamaya 91.2 to broadcast the course specific information
recorded by the faculty members of USOL. These recordings are broadcast under the programme ‘Shiksha Ke Anek Ayam’ since August, 2019.
Print media continues to be popular and advertisements regarding admission to various courses are printed in leading English, Hindi and Punjabi newspapers.
Pre-Admission activity
also includes telecast of programmes enlightening the general public about the nature of distance education, the online admission process and the availability of seats. In the programme “Career Counselling; Distance Education” telecast by Doordarshan on 31st July, 2019 details of course and fee structure were given by our Chairperson, Professor Madhurima Verma.
Awareness about distance education programmes is also displayed on the
USOL Facebook Page
. Our distinguished alumni also spread the word. The WhatsApp groups provide yet another platform to disseminate information regarding admission in addition to responding to admission related queries.
USOL educates the potential learners through YOUTUBE Channel. Every programme highlights the distinguishing features of its syllabi and also creates awareness about their future prospects.
Sustained efforts are made to reach distance learners using different media.

5.1.7 Strategy followed by DDE for dispatch of study material to learners
In USOL there is a proper mailing section with A.R Printing as the Head and a dedicated team which looks after the dispatch of study material to the students.
A Lesson Dispatch Committee
is constituted annually which supervises the timely dispatch of the study material. This committee consists of faculty members of USOL.
In the admission form, the students are given the option as to -whether they want to receive
study material by post or collect personally
.
Keeping in view the preferred options, the study material is provided to the learners. They are given the study material when they visit the department if they have opted for personal collection. In case the students have opted for study material by post, then it is dispatched to the address given by the students.
However, if the complete study material is not ready, then it is dispatched in phased manners. Students are informed through email about the dispatch of study material. In any case, it is ensured that students receive study material well in time.
In case of B.Ed. and MBA Programmes where the number of seats is limited and admission is done on the basis of merit, physical counselling is done for admission. The admitted students are given study material on the spot at the time of counselling
We upload the study material on the
USOL website
for easy and timely access by the students.

5.3.2 Presence of Student Council and its activities for institutional development and student welfare.
Punjab University Student Council
is a proactive student body of Panjab University that is elected under the guidelines of the Lyngdoh Committee. Student elections are held every year and the students are given ample opportunities to voice their concerns on various issues. They are always encouraged to work democratically and amicably with the authorities. The Student Executive Council is centrally located in Student Centre with its own office. Student Council works closely with the Department Representatives, also elected along with Council. The Student Council plays important role in guiding new students in the admission process while setting up various Help Desks at Panjab University. Students from the council stand at various places to help the students reach their entrance tests. Student Council also plays a significant role as a
bridge
between the administration of the Panjab university and students.

This helps them to overcome the compartmentalization of their disciplines, degrees, and specializations. Religious trips to sacred places like Vaishno Devi, Naina Devi, Amritsar Sahib, and Anandpur Sahib help students to enjoy the rich cultural heritage of the region. The council also conducts academic trips to different parts of India which make the student familiar with the richness of Indian culture.

6.1.1 The institution has a clearly stated vision and mission which are reflected in its academic and administrative governance.
Panjab University envisions being a premier world-class institution, developing and disseminating transformative knowledge
“to create future intellectuals, leaders and innovators”.
It seeks to address
societal needs and challenges and provide equal access and treatment and a safe environment free of discrimination and inequality.
Its mission thus includes offering teaching programmes in line with national and global priorities.
Research collaborations – across disciplines, intra/inter-institutional, national and international – are the cornerstone
of this structure.
Transparency, efficiency, accountability in administration; decentralization and autonomy of departments are the keys to good governance
.
The Panjab University Calendar comprehensively prescribes the governance structure of the University and the rules and regulations for all aspects of its functioning. The norms and standards for various activities of the university are set by the competent authority such as Senate, syndicate etc.
The Senate, a democratic body comprising elected and nominated members representing all stakeholders, governs the University
. The Senate has the power to review the recommendations of the syndicate and the academic council.  They meet quarterly; its annually elected Syndicate meets monthly.
The Vice-Chancellor provides academic leadership and evolved strategies for the academic growth of the university
in association with the senate, syndicate, DUI, Registrar, COE, FDO, and Dean of various Faculties, etc. The Dean of University Instruction (DUI) is the Academic Head and works as a nodal centre to scrutinize, supervise and synergize academic and administrative activities of teaching departments of Panjab University and its Regional Centres.
The Registrar heads the Administration of the university
in all legal proceedings except where the Senate otherwise resolves to the contrary.
The apex academic body is the Academic Council.
Every Academic Faculty has an elected Dean. The
Dean College Development Council (DCDC)
oversees the affiliated colleges. The
Controller of Examinations
(COE) oversees the mammoth examination machinery. The
Finance and Development Officer (FDO)
is a qualified Chartered Accountant.
Dean Alumni Relations
and
Dean International Students
liaise with the rich alumni base of the University and the international students. The residential, social and cultural needs of the students are looked after by the
Dean of Student Welfare
.
Deans of various faculties
duly elected for one year term is instrumental in over-viewing the changes and
updation of the syllabus after the same has been sent by the Board of Studies to the respective Faculties. Deans are also an important part of the Career Advancement Schemes of respective faculties, besides playing a vital role in committees constituted for research development and grants in their respective faculties. Panjab University has eleven faculties, i.e.,  Faculty of Arts; Science; Business Management and Commerce; Education; Languages; Law; Medical Sciences
;
Pharmaceutical Sciences; Design and Fine Arts; and Dairying, Animal Husbandry and Agriculture.
The
University leadership encourages and grooms younger faculty to take up management roles
through the co-option of faculty in various committees and offering them positions of responsibility (like Coordinators, Associate Directors, Deputy Directors, Secretary of faculty, etc.). The success of this experiment is evident from the fact that most of the younger faculty who joined PU in the early years of their career are currently holding positions of Deans and Directors. This has helped in managing continuity and change.
To promote excellence in research, the University has initiated several mechanisms like seed money grants, travel grants, and funding support for conferences, seminars, and workshops
over the years.

6.1.2 The effective leadership is reflected in various institutional practices such as decentralization and participative management.
Cardinal Principles governing educational administration at Panjab University are to promote learning keeping in view the concern for Access, Equity, Quality, Relevance and Value based Education. This is reflected through promotion of dynamic, decentralized and transparent governance system centric to students, teachers and goals of Panjab University.
The University at present has
74 departments/institutes/centres
and
6 chairs
for teaching and research at the main campus located at Chandigarh. The University at present has
202 affiliated colleges
spread over various pans of Punjab and has
four Regional Centers
, at Kauni (rural), Muktsar, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur. It has
six constituent colleges
located at Sikhwala (Sri Muktsar Sahib), Balachaur (SBS Nagar), Nihal Singh Wala (Moga), Dharamkot (Moga), Mohkam Khan Wala (Ferozepur) and Guru Harsahai (Ferozepur).
The University follows a
decentralized and participative management approach in all academic and administrative activities, initiatives and decision-making by involving Deans, Heads of Departments and faculty members at all levels.
The constitution of various statutory bodies speak evidently of the participative nature of management even at the highest levels.
The system provides for the continuous involvement of all important functionaries and the faculty in decision-making and policy formulation, as also in the formulation of academic, research, and extension programmes.
The Panjab University Senate, its governing body, has 46 elected members
representing all stakeholders of the University including teachers of the University and its affiliated colleges, college principals, academic faculties, registered graduates and civil society
.
All academic decisions are initiated at individual departments where the various committees (
academic, administrative and technical
) include faculty members at all rungs of seniority. An elected
Board of Studies (BoS)
recommends curriculum to its Academic Faculty. Academic faculties are headed by elected Deans and include Professors, Chairpersons and elected members to deliberate these and recommend to the apex Academic body, i.e., the
Academic Council
.
Administrative decisions are taken by a number of
committees
comprising faculty members from the University as well as affiliated colleges. These include the Regulation Committee, the Affiliation Committee and the Board of Finance.
PU administration has a healthy tradition of conducting regular meetings with the Chairpersons
on various aspects of academic and administration, including acedmic scheduling, information sharing on best practices, identifying areas for improvement and feedback analysis.
Representatives of the duly elected Teachers Association and the Non-teaching Staff
are invited to many of the important committees of the university, including being nominated to the Senate.
Student participation is ensured through an elected Student Council
as per the norms of the Lyngdoh Committee. Students are involved in the framing and revision of Syllabi and their representative is allowed to witness Senate Meetings.
Students are included in various committees
including the Grievance Cell, Placement Cell, Committee against Sexual Harassment and Committee for prevention of Ragging. Duly elected student Departmental Representatives are also involved in student related activities.
Thus, PU has Developed Decentralised Educational Management
which promotes dynamic, decentralized and transparent governance system centric to aspirations of students, industry, society and faculty through restructuring and reengineering. Focus of this process is on devolution of administrative powers with a strong focus on e-governance.

6.2.1 The institutional Strategic plan is effectively deployed.
The institute has a student-centric approach and stakeholders are the final beneficiaries of these developments. Activities are planned at the beginning of every academic year through Academic Calendar
and suggestions are sought from faculty members. Keeping with this objective,
Panjab University has provided its teachers, research scholars and students on-campus as well as off-campus access to all its e-resources.
The e-library of Panjab University powered by
K-nimbus
has rich collection of e-resources and databases. The provision of e-library services has improved the research output of Panjab University, visible in the sustained quantum as well as the quality of publications. At the planning stage itself, importance was given to developing a Multidisciplinary innovation ecosystem, which would lead to an incubation centre at an institutional level, project-based learning for students and high-quality research and entrepreneurship. Towards attaining the above-mentioned goals, the university began working towards building an IRINS Portal, having user  friendly features.
PU@IRINS Portal
is a joint venture of INFLIBNET and our university where all details regarding publications and citations of Panjab University faculty members have been integrated in a single window. IRINS is a web-based Research Information Management (RIM) service developed by the Information and Library Network (INFLIBNET) Centre. The portal facilitates academic, R&D organizations and scientists to collect, curate and showcase scholarly communication activities and provides an opportunity to create a scholarly network. IRINS is available as free software-as-service to academic and R&D organizations in India. It supports the integration of existing research management systems such as the HR system, course management, grant management system, institutional repository, open and commercial citation databases, scholarly publishers, etc.
It has integrated with academic identities such as ORCID ID, ScopusID, Research ID, Microsoft Academic ID, and Google Scholar ID for ingesting scholarly publications from various sources.
In PU@IRINS, profiles of 923 academicians of PU which include serving and retired faculty members, scientists, library professionals, etc. have been created.
The portal has many unique and distinct features, including networking of faculty through a co-author network, map of science network and graphical representation of the productivity of the department and individual faculty members. It has multiple benefits for researchers, institutions and funding agencies who wish to collaborate with us.
For research scholars, it is very beneficial to find supervisors for their research work and research focus of the department/centre of PU where they wish to enrol themselves for PhD work. It supports the faculty members by showcasing their research contributions to the peer group, international community and brings funding opportunities from national and international agencies.
This portal provides a department-level h-index and research contributions of their faculty members which can help the university administration assess the research performance of their respective departments for better decision-making and funding.
PU has taken initiative to develop a system of mentorship by creating a database of distinguished faculty members.  This is also in consonance with the recommendations of National Educational Policy, 2020 and the mandate of the UGC for faculty to register on VIDWAN and IRINS portals for any research funding.
So, building this portal is also a great step for the university to implement one of the recommendations of NEP 2020 and comply with the UGC notification.

6.2.2 The functioning of the institutional bodies is effective and efficient as visible from policies, administrative setup, appointment, service rules and procedures, etc.
PU has a robust system, wherein various activities of the University are governed by the Acts, Statutes and rules/regulations/ordinances framed over time.
These are well documented and have been frequently revised/updated to conform to the dynamic nature of educational administration. These have been incorporated in the three volumes of Panjab University Calender.
The institutional bodies of Panjab University
ranging from the Senate and Syndicate to its Academic Council, Faculties, Departments, Institutes and Centers, and its administrative organs including the verticals of Examination, Finance, Establishment, General Administration and College Branch are all functioning as per the rules and regulations laid down in the Calendar of Panjab University. The Senate has the entire management of, and superintendence over the affairs, concerns and property of the University.
The Calendar is amended as and when required with the approval of the Ministry of Education, Government of India, as Panjab University is Inter-State Body Corporate. Hon’ble Vice President of India is the Chancellor of Panjab University. The University follows the Punjab State Service Rules in matters where the Calendar is silent.
All established procedures, as laid down in the founding statutes of the University, are adhered to in letter and spirit
.
The procedures for appointment and promotion of the teaching faculty are adopted from notifications and amendments received from time to time from the University Grants Commission in toto.
The same is routinely circulated among the faculty and duly displayed on the website of the Dean University Instruction as well as the Director of Research and Development.
The Senate and Syndicate ensure that all provisions of UGC Act, the Statutes and the Regulations are observed and also the guidelines from the regulatory authorities like AICTE/NCTE/DCI.
The University keeps a constant watch on the organizational needs through
regular consultative meetings
, thereby monitoring the functions of various divisions / constituents of the University more efficiently.
The three bodies i.e. Senate, Syndicate and Academic Council have adequate representation from the divergent set of stakeholders
namely University faculty, affiliated college principals and faculty, academic administration as well as eminent personalities of society. This diversity in the higher bodies enables the leadership to interact with the stakeholders and in identifying the organizational needs.
It also promotes a culture of participative management.
The educational administration of University
is vested in the officers of the University: ViceChancellor, Dean of University Instruction, Registrar, Finance and Development Officer (FDO), Controller of Examinations, Dean of Students Welfare (Men), Dean of Student Welfare (Women), Dean of College Development Council, Dean of different faculties, Director Research and Development Cell, Dean International Students, Dean Alumni Relations and Chief of University Security etc.
The decentralised structure of the university ensures that the individual Departments are managed in a participative manner through its academic, administrative and technical committees
, which meet on regular basis to ensure futuristic vision and  resolution of grievances, if any.
PU makes earnest efforts to offer all due benefits to both the teaching and administrative staff through a transparent selection procedures and timely promotions.In the year (2020-21) more than a hundred teachers were promoted under Career Advancement Scheme despite the challenging situation that had developed in the wake of COVID-19.

6.5.1 Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) has contributed significantly for institutionalizing the quality assurance strategies and processes by constantly reviewing the teaching learning process, structures & methodologies of operations and learning outcomes at periodic intervals.
IQAC, constituted in the University under the Chairmanship of the Vice Chancellor, functions as a nodal agency of the University for quality-related issues, with a clear mandate to develop measures for quality sustenance and enhancement.
The cardinal principles of IQAC cell are to promote quality consciousness among all the stakeholders
. It has evolved mechanisms to record and monitor the healthy practices adopted by the various wings of the University.
The IQAC Cell also deliberates on various aspects of quality sustenance, quality enhancement and the action which can ensure the quality culture in PU and its various wings.
The University has a constant endeavour to ensure quality at various levels in the University and has been clearly stated in the Vision-2020 document of the University, which has now been thoroughly reviewed and revised as PU Vision-2025. The various wings of the University are empowered to formulate and implement the policies as per the rules of the University to maintain quality.
While following the bottom-up approach, the Boards of Studies of respective departments, Research Promotion Cells (RPC), Departmental Research Monitoring Committees (RMCs), Departmental
Committees and other stakeholders define and deploy the quality benchmarks.
The IQAC on the University campus ensures the successful implementation of these policies and provides requisite information to facilitate decision making.
The following illustrations exhibit practices institutionalized at PU as a result of IQAC initiatives:
Use and enrichment of ICT infrastructure for teaching-learning-administrative Processes:
The IQAC has been instrumental towards the successful implementation of modern technology in the University’s administrative functioning through ICT.
IQAC has developed Panjab University Information Resource Portal (IRP), which is an innovative way to collect and organize information from 74 teaching Departments as well as administrative organs.
The details about the faculty and administration, can be accessed for quick decision making. This portal also helps IQAC to collect, organize and submit information to NIRF-MHRD, NAAC, AISHEMHRD, Times-Higher Education and QS World Rankings, etc.in a timely and efficient manner.
Automation of admission, financial and examination processes, and upgradation of Wi-Fi and LAN facilities have significantly contributed to an enhanced quality of teaching-learning experience.
Web Link for IRP at PU: http://irb.pu.ac.in/ (Intranet).
Implementation of a Sound Feedback System
The IQAC collects the feedback of
various stakeholders (Students, Teachers, Alumni, Employers and Parents)
to assess outcomes of its teaching-learning processes and the performance of the students and teachers. Realizing the importance of feedback in teaching and research in the present-day competitive academic environment, the IQAC has evolved, identified and implemented a system of obtaining feedback from the stakeholders and
prepare action taken reports
, which are analysed at various fora, including meetings with the Chairpersons. In pursuance of the direction of the University, every effort is made to remain in touch with the stakeholders to collect as much feedback from them as possible to ensure commitment and sincerity among the academic community.
The feedback received is scrutinized, analyzed and utilized for quality enhancement and improvement in various aspects such as curriculum enrichment, infrastructural facilities, augmentation of research facilities
which result in student progression and enhancing societal contributions of the university. Weblink for Feedback forms are available on IQAC website.

Leveraging ICT for improving academic and administrative functioning
. Notable  initiative was the introduction and implementation of ICT based University Management System for all the students and faculty and the second was the introduction of the Panjab University Information Resource Portal (IRB)( http://irb.pu.ac.in/ (Intranet)),
which is an innovative way to collect and organize Information from 74 teaching Departments and administrative wings.
Encouraging and ensuring continual reforms in teaching-learning methodologies
by laying impetus on the adoption of ICT and participatory learning in teaching practices as well as computerisation of the examination.
For Honours School system, Engineering courses as well as UIAMS and UBS, the answer sheetsare duly shown to students to their satisfaction after evaluation
. Thus, these scripts after examination are retained in the Department concerned for evaluation by the internal teachers and the answer books are shown to students after evaluation. The awards are finalized after sorting out/removing the queries/doubt of students, if any, regarding evaluation. With this system, the checking of answer books and re-evaluation of answer books are no longer required resulting in saving time and providing much-required transparency in evaluation.
The university adopts the method of spot evaluation (Central) and dispatches answer books for evaluation at the residence of examiners.
Double evaluation is adopted in case of such students who wish their scripts to be re-evaluated.
Panjab University has constituted a grievance redressal cell
at campus to handle grievances of students and staff. To reduce students’ grievances and to counsel them, there is a mechanism in place through which students are assigned to each teacher, who act as the mentors.
Panjab University has also launched an online examination grievance-monitoring system toredress examination-related queries in a time-bound manner
. The University
has set up a special cell headed by a Senior Professor to handle complaints of sexual harassment on campus
. Another special cell is there to
handle complaints of ragging on the campus and its hostels
. Not only does it generate opinion among students against ragging but also hears all such complaints.
More than 85% of faculty have completed their PhD/Superspeciality degrees
.
Huge improvement regarding sanitation in hostels and washrooms on the campus,
by periofic repairs and maintainence. Approx. Rs. 133 crore have been utilised for renovation and maintenece of the infrastructure. Bio-gas plant with capacity of 1 ton has been installed near boys hostel no. 3.
Four new hostels in Sector-25 have been constructed so as to enhance availability of rooms forstudents. Well-furnished reading rooms have been constructed in each hostel.
This is an indicator that PU is a preferred educational destination of students from far flung areas.
IQAC co-ordinated development of Course outcomes (COs) and Programme outcomes (POs)
in order to lay emphasis on skills to be imparted to students through teaching-learning pedagogy.

Criteria 7. Institutional Values and Best Practices
7.1.1 Measures initiated by the Institution for the promotion of gender equity during the last five years.
a) Curricular Activities:
A large number of programs/ courses are run by the University focusing wholly or partially on promoting gender equity and sensitization.
The
Dept-cum-Centre for Women’s Studies
is wholly focused on promoting gender equity and sensitization, while those of the
Centre for Human Rights and Duties and Centre for Social Work
has approximately 50 per cent of the social sciences programs focused on this theme. Other Departments, such as Community Education and development, Political Science, History, Sociology and English, have one to two papers specific to the theme.
In addition,
a compulsory paper
has been introduced at the undergraduate level on
Domestic Violence and Child Abuse
.
b). Co-curricular Activities  and Extra-Curricular Activities:
Each Department of the University organises a large number of seminars/ workshops/ symposia/special lectures on the theme of gender equity and sensitisation.
Approximately 190 programs were organised in last five
years.
https://archive.iqac.puchd.ac.in/naac-docs/c7/gender/7.1.1-events-SSR.pdf
Training Programmes are organised with gender equity and sensitization as the central focus. The
Faculty Development Programmes and Refresher Courses organised by HRDC Centre and ICSSR have a component on gender equity.
c) Extra-Curricular Activities:
Within the Campus: Debates, Poster making competitions, etc.
Outside the Campus: Gender equity and sensitisation within the campus would have no value without a similar effort outside the ivory towers of the University. Panjab University has a dedicated Department- the Department – cum-Centre for Women’s Studies and Development which has gender sensitisation as one of its major objectives. This Department since its inception has been conducting numerous gender sensitisation programmes at various levels. https://cwsd.puchd.ac.in/

Institute Distinctiveness: Heritage and Research
Panjab University was reborn in the independent India but having the same DNA of achieving the highest scientific and research goals. The legacy, over the years, was kept intact both in terms of contributing to the scientific endeavors, imbibing the same temperament leading to many world level rankings in the field of research.
A Brief Historical Overview
The department of physics, which is one of the oldest departments in the university, has a long history of many firsts and producing legendary leaders and scientists. One of the biggest citations contributor to the Panjab University’s overall research index is the Experimental High Energy Group. This group was mentored by many globally known stalwarts of that era.
The group was established initially as the Cosmic Ray group and was one of the leading groups in India along with the TIFR, Mumbai. This group, after acquiring the expertise in the other modes of studies of sub-atomic world, further evolved into fixed target, colliding beams, heavy ions groups. The major achievement of these new groups was, which is continuing till date, to establish contact with the international collaborations in Russia (erstwhile USSR) – JINR; Switzerland – CERN in experiments UA1, UA2, LEP I, LEP II, WA98, NA49, World Lab program; Fermilab (USA), BNL (USA); KEK (Japan); DESY (Germany). These collaborative efforts, which required the participating Panjab University group to contribute at par with other collaborators and perform tasks and deliver the outputs, are still going on with the full support of the Government of India funding agencies like, DST and DAE for last many decades.
The new line of collaborations established, in fact built on the solid base of the above mentioned earlier efforts, have given the Panjab University groups international exposure and stature of one of its kind. Projects worth more than
Rs. 30 Cr
in the last twenty years tells the confidence of the scientific community of the country and the funding agencies in participating and representing India in these multi-national big experimental collaborations, namely: DZERO, STAR, ALICE, CMS, BELLE, ZEUS
Big Breakthroughs and Ongoing Experiments
DZERO experiment at Fermilab
– PU group contributed to The Discovery of the
Top Quark
(one of missing pieces of the Standard Model of Particle Physics)
CMS Experiment at CERN
– Experimental Verification of existence of the
Higgs Boson
particle (particle responsible in giving masses to different particles in sub-atomic world)
STAR and ALICE Experiment
– Discovery of Anti-Alpha particles, Signatures of the
Quark-Gluon-Plasma
– the primordial soup of particles which were present at the earliest times just after the Big Bang
BELLE at KEK (Japan)
– Search for
CP-Violation
in the Bottom Quark sector: This may hold a partial key to the Baryonic nature of our visible Universe
NOvA at Fermilab
–
Neutrino Oscillation
experiment for understanding the nature of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos (the second most abundant particle in the visible Universe)
Academic Contributions
These international collaborative efforts have contributed to the Human Resource Development of one of its kind and that to in the University system. The intellectual growth of the contributors is enormous and the local research laboratories have achieved the international standards. For example, the establishment of a
Remote Operations Center (ROC)
for the Fermilab (USA) based NOvA experiment which can be used to monitor/control the experimental detectors in the USA and take scientific data for neutrino studies, establishing a detector fabrication facility approved by the CERN team as being at par with any other such facility available globally.
The
top ranking of university in the academic citations
index comes from the Experimental High Energy Physics (EHEP) group in a big way, and the top few positions in the country, in terms of these indices, are held by the members of the EHEP group in the Panjab University. These collaborations bring in the latest cutting edge technologies to India, either by training manpower on them abroad or by the Transfer-of-Technology (ToT) mode.
Summary
These endeavors, like the above mentioned experiments, continue for decades and the expertise built up in the system brings in the confidence to go for bigger challenges in the field of detector developments, new materials, fast electronics, physics analyses, computing techniques for big data handling, distributive and high performance computing, Artificial Intelligence tools for data analysis. The offshoots of such experimental activities are in large numbers, just to mention one prominent in terms of societal benefit is the Medical Imaging techniques and cheaper Scanning Detectors for medical diagnostics and treatments. Thus one can say that the contribution of such a field of physics has tremendous potential and the funding support, in keeping the collaborations going on, for the future – proposed experiments helps in reaping big!

Panjab University Best practices
Panjab University research policy aims to create and support a research culture for developing and promoting research temper and aptitude amongst all the stakeholders i.e., its teachers, staff and students. This helps everyone to realize the vision and the mission of Panjab University making it one of the major stakeholders to contribute to national development and be one of the leading global players in the R & D ecosystem. It also aims at ensuring the research activities of the University are conforming to the established standards and norms relating to safe and ethical conduct of research.
Best Practice 1:
Title of the Practice:
To create innovation and entrepreneurship through the establishment of a start-up ecosystem: BioNEST at Panjab University.
Objectives of the Practice
The incubators developed through RUSA 2.0 as PUIC, a multidisciplinary incubation space and BioNEST, the bio-incubation space through funding from BIRAC are committed to deliver and provide, its incubatees and anchor associations, state-of-the-art infrastructure, technical, administrative, purchase, networking & scientific support. They are also committed to support its occupants, enthuse a young mind, establish an energetic yet comfortable environment that satisfies the needs of the occupants and enable them to meet national and international standards of quality management. To nurture existing and potential start-ups, we introduce PUIC and BioNEST-Panjab University, Chandigarh bringing together multiple platforms, corporate societies, innovators/inventors, industrialists, educationists, incubators, students, investors, angel funders, material suppliers and stakeholders, venture capitalists, state councils, “government people” on one forum, in order to provoke the establishment of not only an innovation chain but an “Innovation Web”. It brings together the start-ups who were the unrecognized elements in the bio incubation ecosystem and are now a part of the ecosystem. Provides support to establish start-ups either as a standalone entity or as a part of the academia. Not only incubation but support through scale and post incubation fund also (
https://bionest.puchd.ac.in/
).
The Context
The University is promoting and encouraging the youngsters to innovate for the new India- the Atma-Nirbhar Bharat! The primary emphasis is on bringing together different verticals of research for a multi-disciplinary approach to problem-solving and promoting innovation and entrepreneurship keeping in view the ever- dynamic global scenario. This is being achieved through pre-incubation spaces which provide a platform to the youth with an opportunity for spreading their wings in entrepreneurial ventures. Innovators so selected receive support in the form of fellowships, pre-incubation facilities, mentoring support and possible liaison with the industry. Connecting the next in the chain is the incubation space or the incubator which is built to foster and promote entrepreneurial ecosystem in the academic system by creating technology & capacity infrastructure around the potential entrepreneurs.
The Practice
To promote and nurture the culture of design and innovation in the area of smart engineering and technologies. It is to develop hands-on skills and vision among faculty and students, to fabricate and carry out research for making creative prototypes of functionally valuable products and for nurturing entrepreneurial talents in students. We provide an ecosystem encompassing various stages from catalyzing creative problem-solving ideas, to developing prototypes at different technology-readiness levels to promoting and training teams to establish start-ups and enter into partnerships with industry. We are mandated to become self-sustainable Centre of excellence to attract industry and students.
Strategy
The intended PIQ FAIR strategy can help fostering a new research climate in the university. In the strategy, the three central pillars (PIQ) are
To support and develop people involved in research,
To have an impact, which crosses academic boundaries and yields economic, social and cultural benefits to the society at large, and
To aim for quality-oriented research
Supporting these central areas, there are four enabling areas (FAIR) of action as follows:
Providing focus and capitalizing on our physical and intellectual capital through interdisciplinary capabilities,
Ensuring alignmentof research-oriented actions at all levels of the University.
Infusing and ensuring highest standards of research integrity, and
Providing the optimum financial, physical and knowledge resources
Each of these aspects will be in consonance with University mission and vision, with realistic evaluation of where university is and hence a rationale for change, thereby presenting actions points to be undertaken. The research strategy will be implemented against a series of key indicators and targets which will be set out in an implementation plan, developed in conjunction with the stakeholders: faculty, students, societal leaders and industry.
Evidence of Success
Complete technology building platform with state of the art laboratories has been established and has resulted in tangibles. There are 26 + start-ups/ Innovators incubated at Incubation Centre. Some has reached above TRL 4-5 and 2 start-ups have passed TRL-9. Five products have been successfully launched and 2 start-ups have received fund for validation & scale-up. 10 start-ups have received funding through BIG/ BIG like grants, 20-50 Lakhs each for developing POC’s. We have 4 BIG awardees and 5 SAEN awardees. Intellectual property has been protected through over 10 patents in a period of last five years. Start-ups incubated with us have received national/ international recognitions through national awards and international visits & trainings. Under the pre-incubation scheme three teams of under-graduate students and three Post –docs have been selected and funded. This also acts as a pipeline of incubates in the system. A large amount of funding from industry for collaborative Research & Development for Proof-of-concept (POC), Post-POC & scale-up studies & certain joint initiatives in the areas of Bioprocess engineering, Biopharmaceuticals with core focus on vaccine under healthcare segments has been taken. Under the RUSA incubator 13 innovative ideas have been funded and four pre-incubation centres in different areas of Science have been established.
Problems Encountered and Resources Required
.
Space for hot desking, soft landing and wet laboratories for which all the positive efforts are being made and will soon worked out.
Best Practice 2:
Title of Practice:
Sophisticated Analytical Instrumentation Facility/Central Instrumentation Laboratory
Sophisticated Analytical Instrumentation Facility/Central Instrumentation Laboratory is providing Analytical services to researchers and industry throughout the country. This is one of the best centres among 16 SAIF centres created by DST, GoI. It analyse more than 25000 samples serving more than 6000 users pan India. Not only the academic users put this centre on their priority list but Industrial users also prefer to get their samples analysed from this centre as utmost care is taken in analysing the samples to the full satisfaction of users. Another unique point of service is timely results of analysis.
The Centre houses 25 Sophisticated Instruments which include MALDI SYNAPT XS HD Mass Spectrometer, Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Elemental Analyser for CHN, FT-NMR Spectrometer 400 MHz and 500 MHz, X-ray Diffractometer, LC-MS Spectrometer, Liquid Nitrogen Plant Stirling (StirLIN-1), FT-Infra-Red Spectrophotometer, UV-VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer, WD-XRF Spectrometer. GC-Mass Spectrometer, HR-Transmission Electron Microscope, FE-Scanning Electron Microscope, Thermo Gravimetric Analysis, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Small Angle x-ray Scattering.
Objectives of the Practice
The objective of best practice is to provide finest analytical services to the researchers and industry so that they may compete with the researchers at world level by undertaking front line research. The highly technical trained manpower is the back bone of this service. The expert staff analyses the samples as per the requirements of researchers and provide the results in shortest time span. Due to accurate and timely results the users prefer to get their samples analysed from this centre only. This is only due to our best practice that we are analysing more than 25000 samples from more than 5000 users pan India. The centre regularly obtains the feedback of user and incorporate the relevant changes required in the procedure. All the services are online. Payment, billing and sending of result is in digital mode which makes the service more user-friendly and efficient.
The Context
SAIF Panjab University Chandigarh was incepted in the earlier years of the 6th plan. The complete facilities of SAIF/CIL and USIC are working in unison in the service of research and also for imparting practical training to the researchers through workshops. The Centre also undertakes the design, fabrication and repair of electronic instruments required by students and teachers from the University and the colleges around.
The major challenge in implementing the best practices was to mobilise the funds for highly sophisticated instruments and then train the manpower to get accurate results out of these highly advanced instruments. As far as mobilisation of funds is required, the DST is providing liberal grant for past several years due to our outstanding performance among all the SAIF centres of Country. To address the issue of trained manpower, the department started hiring the manpower from own earnings and also conducting two Post Graduate courses i.e. M.Tech. (Instrumentation) and MSc (Instrumentation). These courses provide special training on analytical instrumentation and very helpful in supplying highly specialized trained manpower not only to centre but other research institutes of the country. Further, the department earns enough income to maintain the instruments, procurement of consumables and hiring the trained manpower.
The Practice
The facilities of this Centre go a long way in improving the quality of research being carried out in the Research Institutes and Universities in entire region comprising the States of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Utter Pradesh, Uttrakhand, Delhi Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odesa, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Southern parts of the country. The Academic researchers report around 300 quality research publications and patents every year. The instrumentation facility is also made available to the industries. The outside users are increasing with each passing year. This is due to fact that we provide excellent service to our valuable users. This Centre also caters the service to R&D and industries like Morepen Lab Ltd., Panacea Biotech, Nectar Life Sciences and Saurav Chemicals, Ind Swift Lab, Venus Remedies Adley Lab, Biozenta Life science, Fermenta Biotech, Samson Laboratories, Acme Generics, Oniosome Healthcare, etc. Although there are lots of analytical facilities throughout the country but researchers prefer to come to SAIF, PU Chandigarh due to fact that the department not only provides results but also helps users to interpret these results. Interpretation of results and helping users to reach a scientific conclusion of their work is one of the unique features of this centre. This is one of the reasons that researchers prefer to get their samples analysed from SAIF PU Chandigarh.
The department conducted 55 short term training programs from 2018-19 to 2021-22. Looking at the outcome of these courses the DST awarded the centre with a prestigious GoI program “Synergistic Training program Utilizing the Scientific and Technological Infrastructure” (STUTI). Under this program the department carried out 16 awareness programs imparting training to 1686 students. Further, department organised 22 training programs of 7 day duration each imparting training to more than 800 researchers and faculty covering almost all the states of country.
Evidence of Success
The centre has emerged as a major analytical facility in the country. This is evident from the fact that the DST has established 16 such SAIF centres in the country which are located in India’s most prestigious institutes such as IISC Bangalore, CDRI Lucknow, AIIMS, New Delhi, IIT Madras, IIT Bombay and other such institutes. SAIF, Panjab University Chandigarh has emerged as the topmost institute in all the SAIF institutes of country as far as number of samples analysed is concerned.
The table showing the number of samples, users and revenue earned in last 4 years is as below:

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

Centre for Industry Institute Partnership Programme
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) Cell
Centre for Industry Institute Partnership Programme (CIIPP) has been striving to act as a podium for development and transfer of
		Technical & Managerial competence in the area of research and academics to meet changing needs of the corporate sector and society at large.
On the initiative of our Vice-Chancellor Prof. R.C. Sobti, Padam Shree, Centre for Industry Institute Partnership Programme (CIIPP) in its
		recent initiative in this direction has created Intellectual Property Rights Cell (IPR Cell) in collaboration with Patent Information Centre
		(PIC), Punjab State Council for Science and Technology, Chandigarh.  IPR Cell will provide information, orientation and facilities to scientists
		and researchers of Panjab University and its affiliated institutions for protecting the products of their intellectual powers.  The Cell would also
		be able to guide and advise researchers on how to obtain and sustain patents, facilitate routing of patent searches to Patent Information Centre
		(PIC) and getting the necessary clearances from the competent authorities in the university while filing provisional/complete patent specifications.
		This Cell would also workout various modalities on behalf of the university for technology transfer/commercialization of patented technologies.
Objective and Activities of the Cell
To provide IPRs protection information, orientation and facilities to university researchers & scientists.
To guide & advise researchers on how to obtain & sustain patents and help them approach Patent Information Centre (PIC) - Punjab.
To work as a link between PIC and university and its affiliated colleges.
To facilitate routing of patent searchers to PIC, Punjab.
To get necessary clearances from competent authorities while filing patents and other IPRs like copyright registration and design registration, etc. through PIC.
To workout modalities on behalf of universities for commercialization of patented technologies.
To organize various IPR awareness programmes in collaboration with PIC, Punjab in its campus and affiliated colleges.
Few FAQs
What are Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)?
IPR is a general term covering patents, copyright, trademark, industrial designs, geographical indications, protection of layout design of
		integrated circuits and protection of undisclosed information (trade secrets) and protection of new plant variety.
For which aspects of IPR, we have Legislation in India?
Patents: In India legislations are available for Copyright, Geographical Indications, Plant Varieties, Design, and Semiconductor Integrated
		Circuit Layout Design.
Who are responsible for administration of IPRs in the country?
Patents, designs, trademarks and geographical indications are administrated by the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks
		which is under the control of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  Copyright is under the
		charge of the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
What is a patent?
A patent is an exclusive right granted by a country to the owner of an invention to make, use manufacture and market the invention, provided
		the invention satisfies certain conditions stipulated in the law.  A Letter Patent (a kind of certificate) is issued to the owner of the
		invention by the patent office of the country conferring this right.  Exclusivity of right implies that no one else can make, use, manufacture
		or market the invention without the consent of the patent holder.  This right is available to the owner of the invention only for a limited
		period of time.
What is expected from patentee as an obligation to the State?
A patentee must disclose the invention in a patent document for people to practice it after the expiry of the term of the patent or after the
		patent has lapsed due to nonpayment of maintenance free or practice it with the consent of the patent holder during the life of the patent.
		Disclosure of an invention is a legal requirement for obtaining patent.
How is invention defined in the Indian Patent Act which can qualify for grant of a patent?
Invention means a new product or process involving an inventive step and capable of industrial application.

		Capable of industrial application means that the invention is capable for being made or used in an industry.
How do you explain the term .a new product or a process.?
An invention is considered new or novel if it is not known to the public through publication or prior use anywhere in the world.
		Oral description of the invention in a seminar/conference can also spoil novelty.  Novelty is always assessed in the global context.
How is inventiveness defined in the Indian Patent Act?  Explain the meaning of the term.
Inventive step is defined as a feature of an invention that involves technical advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having
		economic significance or both and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.
In other words a very simple invention can qualify for a patent.  A mere .scintilla. of invention is sufficient to found a valid patent.
What is considered as the date of patent?
The date of patent is the date of filing the application for patent (whether provisional or complete).  The term of the patent is counted
		from this date.
What is the term of a patent in the Indian system?
Term of the patent is 20 years from the date of filing for all types of inventions

Prof. Renu Vig, Vice Chancellor of Panjab University presented a strategic 10-point plan to uplift the standards of State Public Universities (SPUs), offering a practical roadmap to reshape the future of higher education in India.
Ptof Vig made the presentation at the two-day National Workshop on Multi-Disciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERU) organised by Ministry of Education, Government of India on May 1, 2025.
The Ministry of Education had invited vice chancellors from 64 state universities, along with State Project Directors from RUSA 2.0, to work together on draft papers covering twelve key themes. Panjab University led a consortium that included HP University Shimla, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology (Hisar), Gondwana University (Gadchiroli) and Kannur University, under the guidance of Sh Rubinderjit Singh Brar, Director of Higher Education, Chandigarh.
Union Minister of State for Education Dr. Sukanta Majumdar inaugurated the workshop at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in New Delhi. Today’s valedictory session featured Union Education Minister Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, who praised the collaborative efforts of all participants.
Speaking on “Providing Quality Education: Accreditation and Ranking,” Prof. Vig argued that current accreditation systems focus too much on paperwork and must shift toward real measures of quality, innovation, and outcomes. She proposed making accreditation mandatory for every higher-education institution by 2030, aligning more closely with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and international standards.
To tackle the uneven implementation of NEP reforms, Prof. Vig detailed her ten-point framework:
Curriculum Reform
– Design flexible, interdisciplinary courses that meet India’s needs and global trends.
Research Infrastructure
– Invest in labs, libraries and digital resources.
Innovation Hubs
– Build links between universities, industry, research bodies and start-ups.
Digital Services
– Set up centralized learning-management systems and automate administrative tasks.
Leadership & Governance
– Grant more autonomy, encourage participative decision-making, and develop strategic plans.
Performance Monitoring
– Use transparent metrics to track progress.
Faculty Support
– Offer welfare programs, training and leadership development for teachers.
International Accreditation
– Push universities to seek global quality marks.
Global Collaborations
– Promote joint projects and dual-degree programmes with overseas partners.
Outcome Orientation
– Focus on measurable improvements in student learning and research impact.
After Prof. Vig’s talk, a lively Q&A session drew questions from education leaders nationwide. The session was chaired by Prof. Anil Kumar Nassa, Member-Secretary of the National Board of Accreditation (NBA), and Prof. Ganesan Kannabiran, Director of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).
Dr. Anil Kumar Nassa explained NBA’s role in accrediting specific technical and management programmes based on nine graduate-attribute criteria. He also reviewed the evolution of the NIRF ranking exercise, which began in 2015 with three categories and now covers eleven. Key ranking parameters include enrolment & courses, teaching-learning, research & innovation, outreach & inclusivity, and peer perception—each weighted differently to reflect its importance.
Prof. Ganesan Kannabiran described how NAAC has sparked a nationwide quality movement in higher education, aiming for “Viksit Bharat 2047.” NAAC follows a “Light but Tight” accreditation model, offers mentorship to institutions in aspirational districts, and plans to introduce a Maturity-Based Graded Levels (MBGL) framework for global positioning. He also spoke about NAAC’s focus on social-responsibility initiatives and regional consultations with universities, industry and other stakeholders.
Among those in attendance were Dr. Vineet Joshi, Secretary of the Department of Higher Education; Shri Sunil Kumar Barnwal, Additional Secretary at the Ministry of Education; Prof. T G Sitharam, Chairman of AICTE; Prof. Anil Sahasrabudhe, Chairperson of NETF; Shri Armstrong Pame, Joint Secretary; former UGC Chairman Prof. M. Jagadesh Kumar; as well as vice chancellors, policymakers and academic experts.
Over the two days, participants also explored topics such as e-governance, UGC regulations, university clustering, holistic education with skill development, equity and access, teaching in local languages, research internationalisation, faculty development, the Indian knowledge system, and digital transformation. The workshop’s mix of strategy, discussion and collaboration is expected to pave the way for stronger, more innovative state universities in the years ahead.

Hands-On Workshop On Outcome Based Education (OBE) 16-17 November 2023
Dr. S. S. B UICET
Panjab University, 					Chandigarh

Profile of Panjab University
Brief History and Present Infrastructure
One of the oldest Universities in India, the Panjab University (PU) initiated at Lahore in 1882, has a long tradition of pursuing excellence in teaching and research in science and technology, humanities, social sciences, performing arts and sports. The University supports excellence and innovation in academic programmes, promotes excellence in research, scholarship and teaching.
The University is committed to attract and support the best students and faculty, who excel at teaching and research. In independent India, Panjab University with its Campus at Chandigarh and nearly 202 affiliated colleges in Punjab state and Chandigarh U.T., has served various societal needs with distinction. The glorious traditions of the University established during the period of more than 140 years of its long service to the nation since its inception are a source of inspiration for the present generation of faculty members and students. By virtue of its history, experience, achievements and philosophy, the Panjab University has a national character and it enjoys an international stature drawing both faculty and students from all over the country and different parts of the globe. Its faculty includes some of the most distinguished scientists and academicians. It continues to attract celebrated scholars at the campus. Over the years, the reputation of the Panjab University has grown to emerge as an institution at the pinnacle in innovative teaching, research and community outreach.
In  Chandigarh, the newly built capital of Punjab, a beautiful  red sandstone campus was designed for the Panjab University by Pierre Jeanneret under the general guidance of Le Corbusier. Panjab University moved here during 1958-1960. Till the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the University had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla and Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were located in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. With the re-organization of Punjab, the University became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organized States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Gradually, the colleges of Himachal and Haryana were affiliated to the Universities in the respective states and the Panjab University was left with the affiliated colleges in the Union Territory of Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab. The Panjab University Campus at Chandigarh accommodates seventy four teaching and research departments/institutes/centres besides six independent Chairs for research. Furthermore, the university has 202 affiliated and 6 Constituent Colleges spread over Punjab and Chandigarh besides Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Kauni. In addition, there is the Vishveshavaranand Vishwa Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies at Hoshiarpur.
The Campus
Panjab University is located in Sector 14 and Sector 25 of Chandigarh, spreading across an area of almost 550 acres.
The layout of two campuses of the University has been conceived to meet the academic, administrative, sports/recreational, residential and other requirements of a growing
University. To make it self-contained, infrastructural facilities like its own Shopping Centre, Health Centre, Bank, Post office, Swimming Pool, Gymnasium, Sports Grounds, Botanical Gardens, well maintained parks, Open Air Theatre, Guest Houses, Faculty House, Seminar Complexes, Alumni House, Community Centre and a school, have been provided. Besides these facilities, the University Campus has 8 hostels for boys, 10 hostels for girls, a Working Women Hostel and International Hostel and 2 sports hostels.
A cluster of prominent buildings like the Gandhi Bhawan, the Fine Arts Museum, the University Library and the Student Centre form the hub of social interaction. The three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan, considered the pride of the University, is its most artistic building. The Fine Arts Museum, with its series of small galleries arranged around a courtyard, each gallery having a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (umbrella shaped), is not only an architectural but a structural marvel as well. The University Library, another key building, in the Sector 14 Campus is an RCC framed structure with red sandstone veneers. The Student Centre, with its circular base and a ramp pulsating around its cylindrical body, is another landmark building.
Teaching Departments/Centres
The academic institutes on the campus and  four Regional Centres are grouped under the Faculties of Arts, Science, Languages, Law, Education and Fine Arts, Business Management and Commerce, Engineering and Technology, Medical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Dairying, Animal Husbandry and Agriculture. Most of the departments have their own specialized libraries, and the working period runs for at least 180 days in a year.

Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

Vice Chancellor
Professor Renu Vig
Vice Chancellor Panjab University
Professor (Dr.) Renu Vig is discharging the responsibilities of Vice-Chancellor of Panjab University since Jan 16, 2023. Prior to this, she has held several key positions at Panjab University-Dean University Instruction, Dean Research, Dean Faculty of Engineering & Technology, and Director UIET. With a teaching and research experience of more than 35 years, Professor Renu Vig holds a Ph.D. in Engineering and Technology in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.
She has a stellar academic record having been awarded Gold Medal by Panjab University for standing first in B.E. across all departments in Punjab Engineering College and other affiliated colleges, and Roll of Honour for standing third in Pre-Engineering, Panjab University. In addition to academics and research, the exemplary contribution she made during sabbatical project undertaken at Infosys Technologies Ltd earned her appreciation letter from Dr. M.P. Ravindra, Vice President and Head, Education & Research Dept., Infosys Technologies Ltd.
She has guided 10 PhD successfully in the area of Signal Processing and Fuzzy Logic based control. She has more than 100 SCI/Scopus indexed reputed research publications to her credit. She has visited prestigious institutions such as University of Cambridge, University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham and National University of Singapore. She has presented paper in World Congress on Engineering at Imperial College London.
Professor Renu Vig has significant experience of conceiving projects for arranging grants from various agencies. Under her leadership, UIET received Rs. 10 crore grant under TEQIP-II project of MHRD for sub Component 1.1 i.e. Strengthening Institutions to improve Learning outcomes and Employability of Graduates. UIET was selected as a well performing institute, and additional Grant of Rs. 5 crore was sanctioned by MHRD. She successfully set up Design Innovation Centre funded by MHRD at Panjab University. This project was worth Rs. 10 Crore and initiatives are being taken to promote design and innovation culture among students and faculty.
Professor Renu Vig is Principal Investigator of
Project
'Robust Automatic Segregation of Defective Fasteners in Industries using Deep Learning' executed in
collaboration with Nottingham Trent University
. The objective of the project was to design an autonomous system using deep learning techniques for the efficient classification of defective and non-defective fasteners in small and medium-scale industries, aiming to replace traditional manual methods that are often time-consuming and inefficient. The process begins with the collection of a diverse dataset of fastener images under consistent conditions, followed by preprocessing steps such as labelling, resizing, and augmentation to prepare the data for training. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then developed and trained to accurately classify the fasteners based on visual defects. Once the model is validated, it is integrated with an embedded system equipped with a camera for real-time image capture and analysis.
Professor Renu Vig is the Inventor for patent entitled 'Distress Signal Based Criminal Activity Detecting, Preventing and Reporting Device, System and Method' and Panjab University is the patentee. This intelligent system is capable of detecting distress voices or panic screams automatically without the need of a specific trigger word or manual activation. Upon detecting a distress signal, the device can immediately alert the nearest police station and sound an ultrasonic alarm at the location to confuse the attacker.
Professor Renu Vig has spearheaded several key initiatives in Panjab University dealing with various crucial aspects as given below.
NAAC Accreditation
:
She played a pivotal role in securing the prestigious NAAC A++ grade with a score of 3.68, the highest in the university's history. Under her leadership, the university implemented strategic improvements across all seven NAAC assessment parameters, including curricular enhancements, research innovation, and infrastructure upgrades. She ensured meticulous preparation for the NAAC peer team visit, with mock drills, campus revamps, and a comprehensive Self-Study Report (SSR).
Her collaborative approach—engaging faculty, staff, and stakeholders—and her focus on addressing past NAAC feedback were instrumental in this achievement, elevating Panjab University to India's elite institutions.
National Education Policy (NEP) Implementation
:
Panjab University initiated NEP implementation in the academic session 2023-24, and affiliated colleges in session 2024-25. A wide array of Skill Enhancement Courses (100 new courses) and Value Added Courses (approximately 75 courses) are now available. The first NEP batch will graduate from Panjab University in 2027 and from affiliated colleges in 2028. By July 2027, Panjab University must be prepared to offer a one-year Master's Program for students who have graduated with 4-year Honors/Research Degrees.
Strengthening Entrepreneurial Culture
:
The entrepreneurial culture is being strengthened by the Panjab University Incubation Centre. Skill-oriented courses are regularly organized by the Centre for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Currently, PU has more than 50 successful startups, and this ecosystem will be further strengthened through initiatives like Idea Hackathons, pitching for funds in presence of investors, industry and academia meets etc.
The S&T cluster, in collaboration with IIT Ropar through the Section 8 company PI-RAHI (
Panjab University, IIT Ropar - Regional Accelerator for Holistic Innovations
), has become operational. Efforts are being made to develop technologies and subsequently commercialize them in various areas such as medical devices, green energy, AI and Machine Learning, waste management, healthcare, agriculture etc. Institutions and organizations in the northern region are being encouraged to find solutions for industry and society.
Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security
:
The establishment of a Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Cyber Security, in collaboration with the Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC), an international cyber security non-profit foundation, is envisaged. An MoU has already been signed with ISAC for capacity building in Cyber Security.
Digital Transformation through e-SAMARTH Deployment
:
Under her visionary leadership, Panjab University has adopted the e-SAMARTH ERP system, a cloud-based platform launched by the Ministry of Education under the National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT). This initiative aims to consolidate fragmented data across colleges/departments into a unified digital framework, enhancing transparency and efficiency.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

About Research & Development Cell
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages the promotion of quality research within the Higher Education system. Research and innovation are important aspects to enhance quality education by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Societal challenges of our country can only be addressed by having a strong and vibrant higher education ecosystem with an emphasis on research, innovation, and technology development. The integration of Research, Innovation and Technology Development is the foundation of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India). The establishment of Research and Development Cell (RDC) in Panjab University, Chandigarh is aimed at enabling the attainment of targets of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat and is expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing multidisciplinary/ transdisciplinary and translational research culture mandated in NEP 2020.

Mission
To create a congenial ecosystem environment for enhanced research productivity.
To promote collaboration across industry, government, community- based organizations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels.
To facilitate greater access to research through optimum utilization and mobilization of existing resources and funding.
Objectives
To build an organizational/ intra-institutional structure with role-based functions of RDC, formulate Research Policy for the University, identify thrust areas of research, and form related cluster groups/ frontline teams/consortia of researchers.
To help the University create Research Policies for recruitment of research personnel, procurement of equipment, and financial management with sufficient autonomy to the Principal Investigator(s) and propagate research outcomes to stakeholders and the public at large.

To act as a mediator between researchers & relevant research funding agencies, provide guidance in preparation & submission of project proposals and post-sanctioning of the grants to supervise adherence to timelines.
To create mechanism for coordination among other cells/centers dealing with University-Industry Inter Linkage, Incubation, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Profile of Panjab University
Brief History and Present Infrastructure
One of the oldest Universities in India, the Panjab University (PU) initiated at Lahore in 1882, has a long tradition of pursuing excellence in teaching and research in science and technology, humanities, social sciences, performing arts and sports. The University supports excellence and innovation in academic programmes, promotes excellence in research, scholarship and teaching.
The University is committed to attract and support the best students and faculty, who excel at teaching and research. In independent India, Panjab University with its Campus at Chandigarh and nearly 202 affiliated colleges in Punjab state and Chandigarh U.T., has served various societal needs with distinction. The glorious traditions of the University established during the period of more than 140 years of its long service to the nation since its inception are a source of inspiration for the present generation of faculty members and students. By virtue of its history, experience, achievements and philosophy, the Panjab University has a national character and it enjoys an international stature drawing both faculty and students from all over the country and different parts of the globe. Its faculty includes some of the most distinguished scientists and academicians. It continues to attract celebrated scholars at the campus. Over the years, the reputation of the Panjab University has grown to emerge as an institution at the pinnacle in innovative teaching, research and community outreach.
In  Chandigarh, the newly built capital of Punjab, a beautiful  red sandstone campus was designed for the Panjab University by Pierre Jeanneret under the general guidance of Le Corbusier. Panjab University moved here during 1958-1960. Till the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the University had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla and Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were located in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. With the re-organization of Punjab, the University became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organized States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Gradually, the colleges of Himachal and Haryana were affiliated to the Universities in the respective states and the Panjab University was left with the affiliated colleges in the Union Territory of Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab. The Panjab University Campus at Chandigarh accommodates seventy four teaching and research departments/institutes/centres besides six independent Chairs for research. Furthermore, the university has 202 affiliated and 6 Constituent Colleges spread over Punjab and Chandigarh besides Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Kauni. In addition, there is the Vishveshavaranand Vishwa Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies at Hoshiarpur.
The Campus
Panjab University is located in Sector 14 and Sector 25 of Chandigarh, spreading across an area of almost 550 acres.
The layout of two campuses of the University has been conceived to meet the academic, administrative, sports/recreational, residential and other requirements of a growing
University. To make it self-contained, infrastructural facilities like its own Shopping Centre, Health Centre, Bank, Post office, Swimming Pool, Gymnasium, Sports Grounds, Botanical Gardens, well maintained parks, Open Air Theatre, Guest Houses, Faculty House, Seminar Complexes, Alumni House, Community Centre and a school, have been provided. Besides these facilities, the University Campus has 8 hostels for boys, 10 hostels for girls, a Working Women Hostel and International Hostel and 2 sports hostels.
A cluster of prominent buildings like the Gandhi Bhawan, the Fine Arts Museum, the University Library and the Student Centre form the hub of social interaction. The three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan, considered the pride of the University, is its most artistic building. The Fine Arts Museum, with its series of small galleries arranged around a courtyard, each gallery having a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (umbrella shaped), is not only an architectural but a structural marvel as well. The University Library, another key building, in the Sector 14 Campus is an RCC framed structure with red sandstone veneers. The Student Centre, with its circular base and a ramp pulsating around its cylindrical body, is another landmark building.
Teaching Departments/Centres
The academic institutes on the campus and  four Regional Centres are grouped under the Faculties of Arts, Science, Languages, Law, Education and Fine Arts, Business Management and Commerce, Engineering and Technology, Medical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Dairying, Animal Husbandry and Agriculture.

Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was approved by the MHRD and launched by Honourable Minister of Human Resource Development on 29th September 2015.
This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

Vice Chancellor
Professor Renu Vig
Vice Chancellor Panjab University
Professor (Dr.) Renu Vig is discharging the responsibilities of Vice-Chancellor of Panjab University since Jan 16, 2023. Prior to this, she has held several key positions at Panjab University-Dean University Instruction, Dean Research, Dean Faculty of Engineering & Technology, and Director UIET. With a teaching and research experience of more than 35 years, Professor Renu Vig holds a Ph.D. in Engineering and Technology in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.
She has a stellar academic record having been awarded Gold Medal by Panjab University for standing first in B.E. across all departments in Punjab Engineering College and other affiliated colleges, and Roll of Honour for standing third in Pre-Engineering, Panjab University. In addition to academics and research, the exemplary contribution she made during sabbatical project undertaken at Infosys Technologies Ltd earned her appreciation letter from Dr. M.P. Ravindra, Vice President and Head, Education & Research Dept., Infosys Technologies Ltd.
She has guided 10 PhD successfully in the area of Signal Processing and Fuzzy Logic based control. She has more than 100 SCI/Scopus indexed reputed research publications to her credit. She has visited prestigious institutions such as University of Cambridge, University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham and National University of Singapore. She has presented paper in World Congress on Engineering at Imperial College London.
Professor Renu Vig has significant experience of conceiving projects for arranging grants from various agencies. Under her leadership, UIET received Rs. 10 crore grant under TEQIP-II project of MHRD for sub Component 1.1 i.e. Strengthening Institutions to improve Learning outcomes and Employability of Graduates. UIET was selected as a well performing institute, and additional Grant of Rs. 5 crore was sanctioned by MHRD. She successfully set up Design Innovation Centre funded by MHRD at Panjab University. This project was worth Rs. 10 Crore and initiatives are being taken to promote design and innovation culture among students and faculty.
Professor Renu Vig is Principal Investigator of
Project
'Robust Automatic Segregation of Defective Fasteners in Industries using Deep Learning' executed in
collaboration with Nottingham Trent University
. The objective of the project was to design an autonomous system using deep learning techniques for the efficient classification of defective and non-defective fasteners in small and medium-scale industries, aiming to replace traditional manual methods that are often time-consuming and inefficient. The process begins with the collection of a diverse dataset of fastener images under consistent conditions, followed by preprocessing steps such as labelling, resizing, and augmentation to prepare the data for training. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then developed and trained to accurately classify the fasteners based on visual defects. Once the model is validated, it is integrated with an embedded system equipped with a camera for real-time image capture and analysis.
Professor Renu Vig is the Inventor for patent entitled 'Distress Signal Based Criminal Activity Detecting, Preventing and Reporting Device, System and Method' and Panjab University is the patentee. This intelligent system is capable of detecting distress voices or panic screams automatically without the need of a specific trigger word or manual activation. Upon detecting a distress signal, the device can immediately alert the nearest police station and sound an ultrasonic alarm at the location to confuse the attacker.
Professor Renu Vig has spearheaded several key initiatives in Panjab University dealing with various crucial aspects as given below.
NAAC Accreditation
:
She played a pivotal role in securing the prestigious NAAC A++ grade with a score of 3.68, the highest in the university's history. Under her leadership, the university implemented strategic improvements across all seven NAAC assessment parameters, including curricular enhancements, research innovation, and infrastructure upgrades. She ensured meticulous preparation for the NAAC peer team visit, with mock drills, campus revamps, and a comprehensive Self-Study Report (SSR).
Her collaborative approach—engaging faculty, staff, and stakeholders—and her focus on addressing past NAAC feedback were instrumental in this achievement, elevating Panjab University to India's elite institutions.
National Education Policy (NEP) Implementation
:
Panjab University initiated NEP implementation in the academic session 2023-24, and affiliated colleges in session 2024-25. A wide array of Skill Enhancement Courses (100 new courses) and Value Added Courses (approximately 75 courses) are now available. The first NEP batch will graduate from Panjab University in 2027 and from affiliated colleges in 2028. By July 2027, Panjab University must be prepared to offer a one-year Master's Program for students who have graduated with 4-year Honors/Research Degrees.
Strengthening Entrepreneurial Culture
:
The entrepreneurial culture is being strengthened by the Panjab University Incubation Centre. Skill-oriented courses are regularly organized by the Centre for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Currently, PU has more than 50 successful startups, and this ecosystem will be further strengthened through initiatives like Idea Hackathons, pitching for funds in presence of investors, industry and academia meets etc.
The S&T cluster, in collaboration with IIT Ropar through the Section 8 company PI-RAHI (

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Research & Development Cell
About Research & Development Cell
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages the promotion of quality research within the Higher Education system. Research and innovation are important aspects to enhance quality education by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Societal challenges of our country can only be addressed by having a strong and vibrant higher education ecosystem with an emphasis on research, innovation, and technology development. The integration of Research, Innovation and Technology Development is the foundation of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India). The establishment of Research and Development Cell (RDC) in Panjab University, Chandigarh is aimed at enabling the attainment of targets of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat and is expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing multidisciplinary/ transdisciplinary and translational research culture mandated in NEP 2020.
Vision
To  put in place a robust mechanism for developing and strengthening the research ecosystem within the University in consonance with the provisions of NEP-2020.
Mission
To create a congenial ecosystem environment for enhanced research productivity.
To promote collaboration across industry, government, community- based organizations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels.
To facilitate greater access to research through optimum utilization and mobilization of existing resources and funding.
Objectives
To build an organizational/ intra-institutional structure with role-based functions of RDC, formulate Research Policy for the University, identify thrust areas of research, and form related cluster groups/ frontline teams/consortia of researchers.
To help the University create Research Policies for recruitment of research personnel, procurement of equipment, and financial management with sufficient autonomy to the Principal Investigator(s) and propagate research outcomes to stakeholders and the public at large.
To put in place policies to promote researchers and innovators, identify potential collaborators from industry, research organizations, academic institutions & other stakeholders for cooperation and synergistic partnerships.
To act as a mediator between researchers & relevant research funding agencies, provide guidance in preparation & submission of project proposals and post-sanctioning of the grants to supervise adherence to timelines.
To create mechanism for coordination among other cells/centers dealing with University-Industry Inter Linkage, Incubation, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions
The establishment of the RDC would facilitate the creation of a research ecosystem for impactful and sustained research output. The essential elements of such an ecosystem, viz., generation of knowledge and facilitation of research, innovation and technology development for industrial & societal benefits, are addressed by human resource (researcher & faculty), intellectual capital (knowledge & skills), governance (regulation & policies) and financial resources (funding & grants).

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.
