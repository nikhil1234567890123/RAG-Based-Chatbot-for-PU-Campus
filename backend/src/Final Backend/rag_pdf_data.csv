Vice-Chancellor’s Message
In today’s interconnected world, India is well-positioned to take
on a leadership role in addressing the concerns of diverse global
stakeholders. In this context, the geo-strategic location of Panjab
University holds immense significance. Emerging trends in the politico-
economic landscape have highlighted the academic importance of this
region, attracting collaborations from several national and international
research agencies.
Panjab University continues to broaden its global footprint,
having signed and maintained over a hundred Memoranda of
Understanding (MoUs) with institutions around the world. Our
university is equipped to meet contemporary challenges through
dedicated research centers that not only focus on technological
advancement but also contribute to policy-making aimed at the
sustainable use of natural resources and enhanced community
participation.
In the financial year 2023–24, government agencies including UGC, DST, ICMR, and the Ministry of
Education have provided generous funding to Panjab University, amounting to Rs.4224 lakh, which
includes Rs.4049 lakh for research projects and Rs.175 lakh under the RUSA Research Grant.
A university thrives through its engagement with the community. It is our mission to reach
underserved sections of society, and in this spirit, we actively conduct outreach programs to promote
awareness on key issues such as Swachhta Abhiyaan, legal rights, and community empowerment in
surrounding villages. Departments have been encouraged to form dedicated committees to implement
these initiatives effectively, ensuring that the benefits of government schemes reach grassroots levels and
contribute to the vision of a resurgent India.
Student groups such as NSS, Enactus, and the Natural Biodiversity Group have played a vital role
in driving our inclusive development efforts. Our students have also demonstrated exceptional
performance in sports. Since the inception of the MAKA Trophy in 1957, Panjab University has secured it
16 times and has also emerged victorious in the Khelo India University Games on two occasions.
Recognizing the need for synergy between academia and industry in today’s world, Panjab
University has established several dedicated centers and verticals, including the Centre for Industry-
Institute Partnership Programme (CIIPP), Technology Enabling Centre (TEC), Centre for Skill
Development and Entrepreneurship (CSDE), BioNest, Centre for Policy Research, University Centre for
Sophisticated Analytical Instrumentation Facility (SAIF), Design Innovation Centre (DIC), and the
Institution’s Innovation Council (IIC).
As we look ahead to India @ 2047, our vision is aligned with the national goal of achieving
inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. Realizing
such an ambitious target demands renewed commitment, rooted in our proud traditions of knowledge
dissemination and self-reliance.
With a vibrant nation, dynamic leadership, and an engaged society, I extend my best wishes to
each one of you as you embark on this new chapter of your life. Let me leave you with this thought:
“Those seeking knowledge will gain knowledge.”

MESSAGE
FROM THE DESK OF THE
DEAN OF UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTION
Prof. Yojna Rawat
Dean of University Instruction
It gives me great pleasure to release the new Handbook of
Information for the academic session 2025-2026. This document
contains all the important and relevant information for teachers and
students of our university. Over the last century and a half, Panjab
University has established itself as a leading institution of higher
learning, emphasizing pedagogical innovations and interdisciplinary
studies.
We aim to provide a compassionate, socially inclusive and
academically conducive environment that fosters intellectual growth
and development. I am happy to announce that Panjab University has
implemented the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 in all
teaching departments w.e.f. the session 2023-2024 and in all
affiliated colleges from the session 2024-2025.
Our University has received several prestigious recognitions. The University Grants Commission (UGC)
has conferred Panjab University with the Category I status, acknowledging our outstanding academic
contributions. We have been accredited with a CGPA of 3.68 on a four-point scale at A++ Grade, valid
for seven years from 12th August 2023.
On Global front, Panjab University ranked 10th in India and 737th globally in the US News – Best
Global University Rankings (2024–2025), ranked 12th in India and 837th worldwide according to the
Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR) 2025, placed in the 601–800 band globally and 201–250
in Asia in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025, ranked 1001–1200

165th position in the first edition of the Times Higher Education Interdisciplinary Science Rankings (ISR)
2025 and was also ranked 710th in the QS World University Sustainability Rankings 2025.
Nationally, Panjab University has been ranked in the 11–50 band in the NIRF Innovation Ranking 2024. In
the NIRF 2024 overall rankings by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, we are 38th in the
University Category, 5th in the State University Category, 7th in the Pharmacy Category, 35th in
Research Category and 60th among all Higher Education Institutions.
We lay equal emphasis on academics and sports, and our achievements in this area are evident from the
fact that we have received the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Trophy (MAKA) sixteen times. Also, Panjab
University conferred with Two Times Champion of Khelo India University Games.
We are committed to maintaining our status as a national leader and drawing worldwide recognition. We
value our relationship with our alumni and strive to maintain a close connection with them through
periodic events. I hope that this Handbook will serve as a guide for students seeking admission to the
university and its Regional Centres, and will inspire a more meaningful and thriving future.
Our goal is to educate students to think critically, become well-informed, productive, and empathetic
individuals. I wish you all success in our collective aspirations towards international excellence and
competence in dealing with complex national and global problems.

7. Preparation of Merit Lists / Normalization of Marks
Admission to both the (General and Reserved) categories of seats shall be on the basis of merit within each category and
the merit list shall be prepared as per these Rules. The basis for preparation of the provisional merit list shall be as
follows:
Marks of other Universities will be normalized to 2400 marks which are 3 years aggregate marks of B.A./B.Sc. (Gen.) of
Panjab University. Similarly, marks obtained by the candidates in the relevant subject will be normalized to 600 marks
which is the total of 3 years aggregate marks of B.A./B.Sc. (Gen.) of elective subjects of Panjab University. The
normalization procedure is explained below:-
a) The marks obtained by a candidate in B.A./B.Sc. will be normalized on the basis of an aggregate. For example, if a
General	SC	ST	BC	Sports	Defence	Persons
with
Disability	Riot/
Terrorist
Victim	Freedom
Fighter	Total
53.5%	15%	7.5%	5%	5%	5%	5%	2%	2%	
19	5	3	2	2	2	2	1	1	37
FRONT PAGES 38 HANDBOOK OF INFORMATION 2025
student has scored 495 marks out of total of 900 marks in B.A./B.Sc., his normalized aggregate marks (out of 2400)
would be :- 495 x 2400/900 = 1320 out of 2400
These marks will be denoted by X and called the Basic Merit Marks.
b) The marks in the relevant subject (i.e., the subject in which the admission is sought) will be normalized by changing
the marks allotted to the relevant subject to 600 in order to give advantage of the subject to a candidate. For
example, if a candidate has obtained 240 marks out of 300 in the relevant subject, then the normalized marks in the
subject would be : 240x 600/300 = 480 out of 600 These may be denoted by Y.
Some universities award B.A./B.Sc. degree on the basis of aggregate marks of B.A./B.Sc. 2nd and 3rd years. In that
case the aggregate marks and the marks of the relevant subject in which the applicant is seeking admission, will be
considered on the basis of marks obtained in B.A./B.Sc. 2nd and 3rd years only for calculation of the basic merit
marks and in the relevant subject.
In some cases, there could be students who have not studied the relevant subject, or the study of the subject is too
elementary to be equated with the standard of B.A./B.Sc. level of Panjab University in the subject in which they are
seeking admission in Post-graduate course. For such category of students Y is taken to be zero.
Candidates having passed B.A./B.Sc. from other universities with 4 elective subjects in addition to optional subjects
at B.A./B.Sc. level shall not be given any credit under Y, i.e. Y shall be taken to be zero
c) (i) Candidates who have passed B.A./B.Sc./B.Com. with Hons. Either from Panjab University or from any other
University would be given 15% weightage of the basic merit marks X obtained for the purpose of admission in
Post-graduate course in the subject in which Honours examination was passed. Similar weightage would be given to
candidates who have passed B.A./B.Sc./B.Com. Examination according to Hons. Like system specializing in one
subject in which the admission is sought for the P.G. course.
For the purpose of admission to LL.M. courses under Panjab University:
Candidates who have passed B.A.LL.B (Hons.), B.Com.LL.B (Hons.), BBA.LLB. (Hons.) and LL.B. (Hons.) either
from Panjab University or from any other University would be given 15% weightage of the basic merit marks,
if certificate / DMC / Degree of candidate specify Hons. as per BCI rules.
Explicitly this weightage would be denoted by Z and calculated as follows:
Z = X x 15/100
(ii) Candidates who have passed a Special Degree from another University will be treated at par with B.A.
Examination of Panjab University with Honours in the relevant subject provided the B.A. Special Degree is
recognized as equivalent to the corresponding B.A. with Honours Degree of Panjab University in the relevant
subject.
d) Where no test is required for admission, the final Merit marks of a candidate would be X+Y+Z+ other weightages
as prescribed at 12.1 and 12.2. Other weightages as prescribed at 16.1 and 16.2 would be calculated on the basic
merit marks X.
e) The process of calculation of percentile scores for admission to B.Sc (Hons.) and B.Pharm. courses will be as follows:
For the B.Sc. (Hons.) admissions, the final merit should be prepared on the basis of merit consisting of three
components (i) CET merit with weightage 75 %, (ii) 10+2 examination merit with weightage 25 %, and (iii) over
and above weightage of NCC, NSS, etc.
For preparing the combined merit of CET for the two streams of students with (i) Physics, Chemistry and
Mathematics combination and (ii) Physics, Chemistry and Biology combination, the two streams should be
evaluated independently. The final merit list for the admission to B.Sc. (Hons.) under the framework of
Honours System should be prepared by adding (i) CET percentile score with 75 % weightage, (ii) 10+2 examination
marks with 25 % weightage, and (iii) over and above weightage of NCC, NSS, etc. in terms of marks.
The CET percentile score (P) for the qualified candidates from the two streams (i) and (ii) will be calculated
separately using the formula
where R is the rank of the candidate in the merit list of that stream and N is the total number of candidates
appeared in that stream. For example, if the number of candidates appearing in a stream (i) is 4000. For a candidate
ranking at 485th position in the merit of stream (i), the percentile score of the candidate will be
The final combined merit list for the two streams will be based on Total merit marks = 0.75*P + 0.25*Q + weightages
for other activities; where P is the CET percentile score, Q is the percentage total marks in the PCB (Physics,
Chemistry & Biology) or PCM (Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics) subjects in the 10+2 or its equivalent
examinations. For the courses where candidates with PCM and PCB combinations are eligible for admission, the
higher of the two will be taken for calculating the Q component. Weightages for activities like NCC, NSS etc. as
mentioned in the handbook of information, if any, will be calculated on the above mentioned Q component. Total
merit marks will be calculated up to third decimal place. Any changes in the marks of the qualifying examination
(10+2 class) or its equivalent examination or other weightages in any case will simply change the total merit marks
of that student and merit list will be updated accordingly.
For admission to B.Sc. (Hons.) under the framework of Honours School System (CBCS) in mathematics where the
admission is based only on marks obtained in mathematics in CET, the marks obtained in CET in Mathematics,
called X1,, will be calculated out of 120. The total marks obtained in 10+2 examination (taking all subjects into
consideration) will be calculated out of 40 called Y1 (i.e. if T = total marks, M= Marks obtained than Y1= (M/T) x 40,
calculate to 2 decimal places. The merit for admission will be X1 + Y1 out of 160.

root level. Social Work is one such discipline that has evolved out of such realization within the realm of social sciences that
caters to the socially marginalized, poor, deprived and the disadvantaged groups through the experts trained for this purpose.
Imparting training in Social Work has also been necessitated by the growing need for partnerships between the State, Civil
society and private voluntary organizations in an effort to bring all the sections of society under the ambit of development. The
Panjab University started the Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) degree programme (2 years, 4 Semesters) in 2007. It combines
education and practice for preparing the postgraduates to work with individuals, families, groups, and communities in a variety
of human service settings. The M.S.W. programme intends to instill in its students, a commitment to improve social conditions,
address social problems and raise their voice against social injustice. The Centre is housed in the building of Emerging Areas,
near Student Centre and behind the Department of Botany, Panjab University, Chandigarh. There is a dress code for the formal
functions and field work forms a mandatory part of the programme.

PLACEMENTS: The Department of Library and Information Science is not just dedicated to placements; we are committed to
nurturing holistic career development for our students, which is further reinforced through active collaboration with the
Central Placement Cell (CPC) of Panjab University. We extend our support by guiding students through competitive exams,
such as the UGC-NET, that are pivotal in the library and information science (LIS) sector. In addition to this collaboration, our
students actively engage in soft-skill development courses provided by the department placement cell as well as CPC. These
courses play a crucial role in enhancing students' employability, equipping them with the necessary skills to thrive in the
competitive job market.
The Department's Placement Cell, functioning as an independent entity, plays a crucial role in this process. It serves as a
dedicated hub for career-related resources, offering personalized assistance in navigating the complexities of competitive
exams. The Placement Cell's support is not confined to placements alone but also includes one-on-one mentoring sessions
tailored to exam-specific requirements. Faculty members are engaged in guiding students toward successful career paths.
Their dedication is reflected in their active dissemination of job-related information, ensuring that students stay abreast of
current industry trends and opportunities. To maximize accessibility, regular job postings are prominently featured on the
department's online notice board and shared across various social media platforms. This strategic approach ensures that our
students are not only well-prepared but also informed about the plethora of job opportunities available in the dynamic field of
library and information science.
Offering students a comprehensive platform for career counselling, training, and placement within diverse library and
information centres, our integrated approach ensures that our students are not only well-prepared for immediate job
placements but are also equipped to excel in competitive exams, opening doors to higher academic pursuits and advanced
career pathways in the dynamic field of library and information science.
ALUMNI RELATIONS: We are dedicated to building long-lasting relationships with our students, even after they complete their
studies in the Department of Library and Information Science. Our alumni are an important part of our academic community,
and we work to create a dynamic network that benefits both current students and graduates. Our goal is to foster a strong
sense of belonging and strengthen the connection between alumni and the department in ways that are both meaningful and
mutually beneficial. Our dedicated forum provides a platform for alumni to actively participate in the exchange of ideas,
sharing insights on academic, cultural, and social events. This collaborative space brings together students, faculty, staff, and
alumni, creating a dynamic network that spans across generations.
Recognizing the wealth of experience our alumni possess, the department frequently invites distinguished graduates to deliver
extension lectures. These sessions provide invaluable real-world perspectives, guidance, and inspiration for the benefit of
current students, bridging the gap between academic knowledge and practical application.
Through strategic alumni relations, we aim to generate robust support and engagement. The diverse experiences and expertise
of our former students contribute significantly to the growth and vitality of our academic community. As esteemed members of
our department, alumni play a pivotal role in shaping its future.
Our commitment to alumni collaboration is an ongoing endeavour, acknowledging and celebrating the enduring impact our
alumni have fostering a sense of community and excellence for generations to come. ""In recent years, the Department has
organized several alumni meets, including active participation and collaboration in the 4th Global Alumni Meet. During these

DEPARTMENT-CUM-CENTRE FOR WOMEN’S STUDIES AND DEVELOPMENT
ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT
The Department-cum-Centre for Women's Studies and Development was originally set up as a Centre for Women's Studies and
Development in 1987. It was one of the first Five Centres set up by the University Grants Commission. On the basis of its
excellent performance, it was one of the six Centres placed in Phase III by the UGC. The Department seeks both to interpret
women's experiences as well as to change women's condition, through a transformation of consciousness, social norms and
modes of action. It visualizes itself as a catalyst to transform an unjust, inegalitarian society into one where gender justice and
equality would be the norm.
The aim is to create and maintain a teaching/learning environment for feminist and gender studies, and provide an impetus for
sustaining a research community that contributes to the development of women's and gender scholarship within the two-third
world/Indian context. The prime objectives are to create awareness, to intellectually equip students and to empower all.
Teaching, Research, Training, Extension, Dissemination, Lobbying and Advocacy are the core activities. It serves as a resource
and nodal Centre for the region and true to its mandate, has developed as a strong academic Centre of teaching and learning,
generating new thinking and knowledge on feminist theory and initiating courses in women's studies. In 2017, Master and
Certificate courses in Governance and Leadership were started and are also being run by the Department.

UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
ABOUT THE INSTITUTE
The University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS) was established almost 80 years ago in Lahore in 1944 and got re-located
on the campus of Panjab University, Chandigarh in 1959. The Institute is one of the most prestigious academic organizations
committed and catering to excellence in all the domains of pharmaceutical sciences. More than 4180 research papers, 290 Ph.Ds, 80
books, 75 patents granted, 45 published & filed, numerous national and international awards, and meritorious recognitions to the
faculty are some of the notable accomplishments of the Institute. Remarkable discoveries of new drugs, molecules & patented
products have seen the reality of industrial commercialization after their successful technology transfers. UIPS has successfully
transferred various technologies and pharmaceutical products to various pharmaceutical industries. Three of the faculty members
have been elected as National Presidents of the prestigious Indian Pharmaceutical Congress too. Three faculty members have
received award from president of India for their outstanding contribution to science and technology. The alumni occupy the highest
echelons in industry, research organizations and academia in India and abroad. Alumni's significant donations helped the institute to
create several annual scholarship schemes to support meritorious and economically weaker students. Institute has very strong
alumni network and scientific collaborations throughout the globe. Because of strong alumni connect and scientific/academic
exposure to diverse domains for overall holistic development of young students, majority of students gets their job through institute
placement cell.
In recognition to its contributions in research and teaching, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has accorded the highest level
of status to the Institute as Centre of Advanced Study (CAS-II) in Pharmaceutical Sciences, the first university Institution in the
country to be granted with this status. The UIPS has been the sole institute of the country that imparted training to more than 700
pharmacy professionals/teachers/ researchers in frontier and thrust domains of pharmaceutical séances under UGC Networking
Resource Centre (NRC) program.
The institute has recently received DST FIST grants (3rd time) with a tune of Rs. 1.18 crores for improvement of S&T infrastructure.
UIPS Faculty have received approximately more than 1 Cr grant for their various research projects funded by various national
governmental/industrial agencies in 2024-25. By virtue of its remarkable persistent and consistent attainments, UIPS has been
ranked among top 10 Pharmacy Institutes of the country in NIRF ranking in last 9 years [Ranked 7 (2024), 8 (2023), 3 (2022), 2

DEPARTMENT OF BIOPHYSICS
ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT
Biophysics has in recent times emerged as an important interdisciplinary subject in Life Science and primarily deals with the
structure, bioenergetics, dynamics and function of the biomolecules. Over the years, the discipline of biophysics has played a
significant role in the growth of critical areas, which include molecular biophysics, physiological biophysics, medical physics,
radiation physics, gene and protein engineering, computational Biophysics, neuro degenerative disorders and membrane
biophysics. Advances in these areas have paved newer initiatives for the designing and development of drugs and medical
technologies.
The Department of Biophysics was established in 1964 and ever since is the only department in the country which offers both
undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the discipline of Biophysics (Hons.). The department also offers excellent research
opportunities leading to the award of Ph.D. degree. The courses being offered to the three year B.Sc.(Hons.) and two year M.Sc.
students in Biophysics are planned in a way, so as to provide a broad base in the subject and are accepted in the diverse fields
of biomedical sciences. Alumni from this department have been always suitably employed and many of them have occupied
coveted positions in the academia, industry, medical institutions, national laboratories and prestigious research institutions in
India and abroad.
The department has been given special assistance grants under UGC-SAP program, Phase DSA-I from April 2015-2020. The
department is also recognized under DST-FIST Programme. For more details see the website http://biophysics.puchd.ac.in

DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY
ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT
The Department of Botany was established in 1919 at Lahore. It shifted to Chandigarh in 1960 from Khalsa College, Amritsar
where it was housed temporarily after partition of the country. The Department has grown into a well-recognised centre for
higher learning and research in structural, functional and evolutionary aspects of plants. The department had DST-FIST
programme and had completed UGC DRS-II phase. Some of the major areas of research are: taxonomy, morphology,
improvement and propagation of economically important plants, ecology of invasive alien plants, physiological up-gradation of
harvest index of some important crops; stress biology of legumes; identification of eco-friendly herbicides and pesticides;
mushroom cultivation; evaluation and conservation of plant diversity; importance of microbes in human welfare and molecular
characterization of gene families involved in development and stress responses. In addition to teaching through modern
techniques, seminars, symposia, workshops, the invited lectures and botanical excursions are an integral part of academic
programme. The department has a well-stocked library with nearly 6814 books and over 60 regular scientific journals. The
department also houses an internally recognized Herbarium (abbreviated as PAN) and a Museum. The P.N. Mehra Botanical
Garden, spread over 16 acres of land is one of the better-known botanical gardens attached to any university of the country.
The department has been getting regular sanction for BSR fellowships under UGC-SAP (DRS-III) programme. Additionally, the
UGC also sanctions funds to the department for infrastructural development from time to time. Besides this, many research
projects are being funded by DST, MoEF, UGC, CSIR, DBT, SERB and MoFPI. The Department has received DST FIST Grant for
the period of 5 years starting from 2020.

INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE & CRIMINOLOGY
ABOUT THE INSTITUTE
Vision: “To create an environment for professionalism & excellence in Forensic Science and train the scientific manpower for
serving the criminal justice system.”
Institute of forensic science and criminology (IFSC) was founded in the year 2009 to serve the criminal justice system
considering the escalating crime rate and the nature of crime. The Institute was crated for training human resources in
Forensic Science and research and the utilization of upcoming advanced scientific techniques in the discipline. Scientific
techniques of every discipline are finding ever new applications in crime investigation and establishing proof in the court of
law. The country needs experts of these forensic techniques for building a robust judicial and instigation system. The institute
is running M.Sc. Forensic Science (Interdisciplinary program) and Ph.D. programs. For supporting the criminal justice system,
we need to keep pace in developing robust forensic techniques. Therefore, the masters (M.Sc.) level empowers a student to use
the latest techniques in investigation of crime and Ph.D. research program is to be explore and validate new scientific
techniques for forensic applications. The Institute is committed to train the human resource in producing ‘scientific workforce’
to meet the need of highly technical personnel to serve the society in an effective and efficient way.
The Institute is unique that it provides training in all aspects related to Forensic Science & Criminology with specialization in
Forensic Biology, Forensic Chemistry and Forensic Physics and is running its course under choice based credit system (CBCS).

DEPARTMENT-CUM -NATIONAL CENTRE FOR HUMAN GENOME STUDIES AND RESEARCH
ABOUT THE CENTRE
Department cum National Centre for Human Genome Studies and Research is relatively new education centre established in
year 2002. The first sequencing of the human genome in 2002 provided a glimpse of humans at our most basic molecular level.
The main goal of our department is to inspire and educate young minds in Genetics and Genomics. Students learn to approach
problems and formulate questions that span the full range of biological systems, from genes to cells to medicine to evolution.
Research in Genetics and Genomics is quickly becoming the key source of new insights, better understanding and targeted
treatments of both rare monogenic diseases and common complex diseases such as coronary heart disease, cancer etc. Our
ethos reflects and fosters a passion for discovery and curiosity and a commitment to excellence. The goal of this Centre is to
provide the most advanced and comprehensive education possible related to human genome at the post graduate level. We
highly value interdisciplinary knowledge and collaboration as the core of our effort. Our research addresses the molecular
mechanisms underlying fundamental processes in biology and disease. We apply genetic, biochemical, cell biological,
computational and biophysical approaches to study various questions/problems in biology. We are motivated towards
understanding of human biology and disease and to develop solutions to societal health problems. Mission is to establish
specific scientific programs that will be available to the public, to improve human health and well-being through education and
research.

CENTRE FOR NUCLEAR MEDICINE
ABOUT THE CENTRE
Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty concerned with the use of safe and small amounts of radioactive materials for
diagnostic, therapeutic, and research purposes. More specifically, nuclear medicine is a part of molecular imaging because it
produces images which reflect biological processes that take place at the cellular and subcellular levels. Though there are many
diagnostic techniques currently available, nuclear medicine uniquely provides information about both the structure and
function of virtually every major organ system within the body. It is this ability to characterize and quantify physiologic
function which separates nuclear medicine from other imaging modalities, such as x-ray, MRI and ultrasound. A typical nuclear
medicine study involves the administration of a radionuclide into the body in order to obtain images of the organs, to perform
various body function studies and to treat diseases.
Nuclear medicine experts designated as Nuclear Medicine Physicists are highly skilled individuals and their responsibilities
include performing in vivo, radiation safety and quality control procedures. Other responsibilities which include operating the
cameras that create images including patient positioning and processing the data for research purposes. The discipline of
nuclear medicine also produces dedicated scientists who develop radiopharmaceuticals/radioisotopes for the imaging of
organs and therapies.
Vision and mission of the Centre
Nuclear medicine is an emerging area in medicine and is growing at a fast pace in India and there is an urgent need for trained
human resource as medical physicists and radiation safety officers for running nuclear medicine departments and industries
that use radioisotopes. Therefore, the centre shall provide trained manpower to cater the needs of various hospitals, medical
colleges/Institutes and Industry in India and abroad. The mission of the M.Sc. Nuclear Medicine Program at Panjab University is
to provide the students an opportunity to achieve expertise both in diagnostic imaging and the rapeutics with clinical hands on
experience in Nuclear Medicine. The Centre imparts a quality education leading to the award of degree in Masters of Science in
Nuclear Medicine and train the students for national/international eligibility test to be designated as certified Radiation safety
officers and medical physicists.
Unique features of the course
Panjab University is the second institution after AIIMS to start M.Sc. Course in Nuclear Medicine. The students shall get ample
opportunity for hands on clinical training in the 2nd year of the course in Nuclear Medicine Clinical setup.

CENTRE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY & BIOINFORMATICS
ABOUT THE CENTRE
The Centre for Systems Biology & Bioinformatics was established at Panjab University, Chandigarh in 2007. The emerging field
of computational and systems biology represents an integration of concepts and ideas from the biological sciences, engineering
disciplines, and computer science. Systems modelling and design are well established in engineering disciplines but are
relatively new to biology. Advances in computational and systems biology require multidisciplinary teams with skill in applying
principles and tools from engineering and computer science to solve problems in biology and medicine. The curriculum of the 2
year M.Sc. course of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics has a strong emphasis on foundational material to encourage students
to become creators of future tools and technologies, rather than merely practitioners of current approaches. Areas of active
research in this field include computational biology and bioinformatics, gene and protein networks, molecular biophysics,
instrumentation engineering, cell and tissue engineering, predictive toxicology and metabolic engineering, imaging and image
informatics, nanobiology and Microsystems, biological design and synthetic biology, neurosystems biology and cancer biology.
The Centre has also started Ph.D. Programme and at present five students are pursuing their Ph.Ds.

Extracts from the decision of the Syndicate dated 22.02.2006 (Para 34) are reproduced below: -
The criterion of ‘employment’ as a condition of eligibility for admission to the Department of Evening Studies be understood,
interpreted and applied liberally and pragmatically, keeping in mind the social purpose of providing opportunity especially to
the underprivileged to upgrade their skills. Accordingly, ‘employment’ would include not only ‘private employment of any
kind’ but self-employment as well. Certificate by the candidate that he is so employed or self-employed would,
therefore, suffice.

UNIERSITY INSTITUTE OF LEGAL STUDIES
The University Institute of Legal Studies (UILS) was established at Panjab University SSG regional Centre Hoshiarpur, in 2007
with the mission of delivering Quality Legal Education to students in rural areas. The Institute offers a 5-year integrated
BALLB (Hons.) course, a 3-year LLB course, and a 1-year LLM course through its regular mode of instruction.
The primary objective of UILS is to serve society by fostering reforms in legal services and producing professionally
competent lawyers, researchers, judicial officers, advocates on record, and, above all , socially responsible citizens who will
wholeheartedly and continually contribute to nation-building.
As one of the prominent multi-faculty off-campus centres of Panjab University, Chandigarh, UILS, PUSSGRC works in harmony
with the University Institute of Legal Studies and the Department of Laws at Panjab University, Chandigarh. The syllabus and
teaching methodologies followed at the Centre are identical to those of Panjab University. The Institute is staffed by highly
qualified law faculty and experts in social sciences and languages, many of whom hold doctoral degrees in their respective
fields. Among the Department’s key facilities are a well-established library and an Advocacy-cum-Communication Skills Lab.
UILS, PUSSGRC, consistently produces university toppers and boasts a 100% placement record. The Institute takes great
pride in its alumni, who are actively contributing to the nation and humanity by administering justice to those in need.
