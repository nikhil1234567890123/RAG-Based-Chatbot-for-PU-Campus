Profile of Panjab University
Brief History and Present Infrastructure
One of the oldest Universities in India, the Panjab University (PU) initiated at Lahore in 1882, has a long tradition of pursuing excellence in teaching and research in science and technology, humanities, social sciences, performing arts and sports. The University supports excellence and innovation in academic programmes, promotes excellence in research, scholarship and teaching.
The University is committed to attract and support the best students and faculty, who excel at teaching and research. In independent India, Panjab University with its Campus at Chandigarh and nearly 202 affiliated colleges in Punjab state and Chandigarh U.T., has served various societal needs with distinction. The glorious traditions of the University established during the period of more than 140 years of its long service to the nation since its inception are a source of inspiration for the present generation of faculty members and students. By virtue of its history, experience, achievements and philosophy, the Panjab University has a national character and it enjoys an international stature drawing both faculty and students from all over the country and different parts of the globe. Its faculty includes some of the most distinguished scientists and academicians. It continues to attract celebrated scholars at the campus. Over the years, the reputation of the Panjab University has grown to emerge as an institution at the pinnacle in innovative teaching, research and community outreach.
In  Chandigarh, the newly built capital of Punjab, a beautiful  red sandstone campus was designed for the Panjab University by Pierre Jeanneret under the general guidance of Le Corbusier. Panjab University moved here during 1958-1960. Till the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the University had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla and Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were located in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. With the re-organization of Punjab, the University became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organized States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Gradually, the colleges of Himachal and Haryana were affiliated to the Universities in the respective states and the Panjab University was left with the affiliated colleges in the Union Territory of Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab. The Panjab University Campus at Chandigarh accommodates seventy four teaching and research departments/institutes/centres besides six independent Chairs for research. Furthermore, the university has 202 affiliated and 6 Constituent Colleges spread over Punjab and Chandigarh besides Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Kauni. In addition, there is the Vishveshavaranand Vishwa Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies at Hoshiarpur.
The Campus
Panjab University is located in Sector 14 and Sector 25 of Chandigarh, spreading across an area of almost 550 acres.
The layout of two campuses of the University has been conceived to meet the academic, administrative, sports/recreational, residential and other requirements of a growing
University. To make it self-contained, infrastructural facilities like its own Shopping Centre, Health Centre, Bank, Post office, Swimming Pool, Gymnasium, Sports Grounds, Botanical Gardens, well maintained parks, Open Air Theatre, Guest Houses, Faculty House, Seminar Complexes, Alumni House, Community Centre and a school, have been provided. Besides these facilities, the University Campus has 8 hostels for boys, 10 hostels for girls, a Working Women Hostel and International Hostel and 2 sports hostels.
A cluster of prominent buildings like the Gandhi Bhawan, the Fine Arts Museum, the University Library and the Student Centre form the hub of social interaction. The three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan, considered the pride of the University, is its most artistic building. The Fine Arts Museum, with its series of small galleries arranged around a courtyard, each gallery having a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (umbrella shaped), is not only an architectural but a structural marvel as well. The University Library, another key building, in the Sector 14 Campus is an RCC framed structure with red sandstone veneers. The Student Centre, with its circular base and a ramp pulsating around its cylindrical body, is another landmark building.
Teaching Departments/Centres

Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

Vice Chancellor
Professor Renu Vig
Vice Chancellor Panjab University
Professor (Dr.) Renu Vig is discharging the responsibilities of Vice-Chancellor of Panjab University since Jan 16, 2023. Prior to this, she has held several key positions at Panjab University-Dean University Instruction, Dean Research, Dean Faculty of Engineering & Technology, and Director UIET. With a teaching and research experience of more than 35 years, Professor Renu Vig holds a Ph.D. in Engineering and Technology in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.
She has a stellar academic record having been awarded Gold Medal by Panjab University for standing first in B.E. across all departments in Punjab Engineering College and other affiliated colleges, and Roll of Honour for standing third in Pre-Engineering, Panjab University. In addition to academics and research, the exemplary contribution she made during sabbatical project undertaken at Infosys Technologies Ltd earned her appreciation letter from Dr. M.P. Ravindra, Vice President and Head, Education & Research Dept., Infosys Technologies Ltd.
She has guided 10 PhD successfully in the area of Signal Processing and Fuzzy Logic based control. She has more than 100 SCI/Scopus indexed reputed research publications to her credit. She has visited prestigious institutions such as University of Cambridge, University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham and National University of Singapore. She has presented paper in World Congress on Engineering at Imperial College London.
Professor Renu Vig has significant experience of conceiving projects for arranging grants from various agencies. Under her leadership, UIET received Rs. 10 crore grant under TEQIP-II project of MHRD for sub Component 1.1 i.e. Strengthening Institutions to improve Learning outcomes and Employability of Graduates. UIET was selected as a well performing institute, and additional Grant of Rs. 5 crore was sanctioned by MHRD. She successfully set up Design Innovation Centre funded by MHRD at Panjab University. This project was worth Rs. 10 Crore and initiatives are being taken to promote design and innovation culture among students and faculty.
Professor Renu Vig is Principal Investigator of
Project
'Robust Automatic Segregation of Defective Fasteners in Industries using Deep Learning' executed in
collaboration with Nottingham Trent University
. The objective of the project was to design an autonomous system using deep learning techniques for the efficient classification of defective and non-defective fasteners in small and medium-scale industries, aiming to replace traditional manual methods that are often time-consuming and inefficient. The process begins with the collection of a diverse dataset of fastener images under consistent conditions, followed by preprocessing steps such as labelling, resizing, and augmentation to prepare the data for training. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then developed and trained to accurately classify the fasteners based on visual defects. Once the model is validated, it is integrated with an embedded system equipped with a camera for real-time image capture and analysis.
Professor Renu Vig is the Inventor for patent entitled 'Distress Signal Based Criminal Activity Detecting, Preventing and Reporting Device, System and Method' and Panjab University is the patentee. This intelligent system is capable of detecting distress voices or panic screams automatically without the need of a specific trigger word or manual activation. Upon detecting a distress signal, the device can immediately alert the nearest police station and sound an ultrasonic alarm at the location to confuse the attacker.
Professor Renu Vig has spearheaded several key initiatives in Panjab University dealing with various crucial aspects as given below.
NAAC Accreditation
:
She played a pivotal role in securing the prestigious NAAC A++ grade with a score of 3.68, the highest in the university's history. Under her leadership, the university implemented strategic improvements across all seven NAAC assessment parameters, including curricular enhancements, research innovation, and infrastructure upgrades. She ensured meticulous preparation for the NAAC peer team visit, with mock drills, campus revamps, and a comprehensive Self-Study Report (SSR).
Her collaborative approach—engaging faculty, staff, and stakeholders—and her focus on addressing past NAAC feedback were instrumental in this achievement, elevating Panjab University to India's elite institutions.
National Education Policy (NEP) Implementation
:
Panjab University initiated NEP implementation in the academic session 2023-24, and affiliated colleges in session 2024-25. A wide array of Skill Enhancement Courses (100 new courses) and Value Added Courses (approximately 75 courses) are now available. The first NEP batch will graduate from Panjab University in 2027 and from affiliated colleges in 2028. By July 2027, Panjab University must be prepared to offer a one-year Master's Program for students who have graduated with 4-year Honors/Research Degrees.
Strengthening Entrepreneurial Culture
:
The entrepreneurial culture is being strengthened by the Panjab University Incubation Centre. Skill-oriented courses are regularly organized by the Centre for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Currently, PU has more than 50 successful startups, and this ecosystem will be further strengthened through initiatives like Idea Hackathons, pitching for funds in presence of investors, industry and academia meets etc.
The S&T cluster, in collaboration with IIT Ropar through the Section 8 company PI-RAHI (
Panjab University, IIT Ropar - Regional Accelerator for Holistic Innovations
), has become operational. Efforts are being made to develop technologies and subsequently commercialize them in various areas such as medical devices, green energy, AI and Machine Learning, waste management, healthcare, agriculture etc. Institutions and organizations in the northern region are being encouraged to find solutions for industry and society.
Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security
:
The establishment of a Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Cyber Security, in collaboration with the Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC), an international cyber security non-profit foundation, is envisaged. An MoU has already been signed with ISAC for capacity building in Cyber Security.
Digital Transformation through e-SAMARTH Deployment
:
Under her visionary leadership, Panjab University has adopted the e-SAMARTH ERP system, a cloud-based platform launched by the Ministry of Education under the National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT). This initiative aims to consolidate fragmented data across colleges/departments into a unified digital framework, enhancing transparency and efficiency.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

Profile of Panjab University
Brief History and Present Infrastructure
One of the oldest Universities in India, the Panjab University (PU) initiated at Lahore in 1882, has a long tradition of pursuing excellence in teaching and research in science and technology, humanities, social sciences, performing arts and sports. The University supports excellence and innovation in academic programmes, promotes excellence in research, scholarship and teaching.
The University is committed to attract and support the best students and faculty, who excel at teaching and research. In independent India, Panjab University with its Campus at Chandigarh and nearly 202 affiliated colleges in Punjab state and Chandigarh U.T., has served various societal needs with distinction. The glorious traditions of the University established during the period of more than 140 years of its long service to the nation since its inception are a source of inspiration for the present generation of faculty members and students. By virtue of its history, experience, achievements and philosophy, the Panjab University has a national character and it enjoys an international stature drawing both faculty and students from all over the country and different parts of the globe. Its faculty includes some of the most distinguished scientists and academicians. It continues to attract celebrated scholars at the campus. Over the years, the reputation of the Panjab University has grown to emerge as an institution at the pinnacle in innovative teaching, research and community outreach.
In  Chandigarh, the newly built capital of Punjab, a beautiful  red sandstone campus was designed for the Panjab University by Pierre Jeanneret under the general guidance of Le Corbusier. Panjab University moved here during 1958-1960. Till the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the University had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla and Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were located in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. With the re-organization of Punjab, the University became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organized States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Gradually, the colleges of Himachal and Haryana were affiliated to the Universities in the respective states and the Panjab University was left with the affiliated colleges in the Union Territory of Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab. The Panjab University Campus at Chandigarh accommodates seventy four teaching and research departments/institutes/centres besides six independent Chairs for research. Furthermore, the university has 202 affiliated and 6 Constituent Colleges spread over Punjab and Chandigarh besides Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Kauni. In addition, there is the Vishveshavaranand Vishwa Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies at Hoshiarpur.
The Campus
Panjab University is located in Sector 14 and Sector 25 of Chandigarh, spreading across an area of almost 550 acres.
The layout of two campuses of the University has been conceived to meet the academic, administrative, sports/recreational, residential and other requirements of a growing
University. To make it self-contained, infrastructural facilities like its own Shopping Centre, Health Centre, Bank, Post office, Swimming Pool, Gymnasium, Sports Grounds, Botanical Gardens, well maintained parks, Open Air Theatre, Guest Houses, Faculty House, Seminar Complexes, Alumni House, Community Centre and a school, have been provided. Besides these facilities, the University Campus has 8 hostels for boys, 10 hostels for girls, a Working Women Hostel and International Hostel and 2 sports hostels.
A cluster of prominent buildings like the Gandhi Bhawan, the Fine Arts Museum, the University Library and the Student Centre form the hub of social interaction. The three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan, considered the pride of the University, is its most artistic building. The Fine Arts Museum, with its series of small galleries arranged around a courtyard, each gallery having a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (umbrella shaped), is not only an architectural but a structural marvel as well. The University Library, another key building, in the Sector 14 Campus is an RCC framed structure with red sandstone veneers. The Student Centre, with its circular base and a ramp pulsating around its cylindrical body, is another landmark building.
Teaching Departments/Centres
The academic institutes on the campus and  four Regional Centres are grouped under the Faculties of Arts, Science, Languages, Law, Education and Fine Arts, Business Management and Commerce, Engineering and Technology, Medical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Dairying, Animal Husbandry and Agriculture. Most of the departments have their own specialized libraries, and the working period runs for at least 180 days in a year.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

About Central Animal House
The Central Animal House of the Panjab University was established in 1986.It is a premier institution of animal breeding and supply in the country. A number of animals are used with the humane care in our department for conducting a variety of experiments on animals for biomedical and behavioural research, with the basic objective of, advancement of biological knowledge which is useful for saving the lives and /or alleviating the suffering of human being, animals and plants., However such experiments are performed with due care so as to minimise the pain inflicted on animals.
Adequate veterinary care is provided. Daily observation of animals is accomplished by animal technicians who have training and experience in laboratory animal sciences and medicine, are handling the breeding and experimentation carried out by research scientists.
Animal House has 2 wings; breeding and experimental.

They are fed nutritional diet and filtered water. Fresh movement of air in animal rooms is controlled by exhaust fans. Air conditioners are provided in each animal room where proper temperature in maintained for breeding throughout the year. We have washing yard for cleaning animal cages and autoclave for sterilization. We are having 62 KV power generators to maintain continuous electricity supply during power cut or breakdown.

Profile of Panjab University
Brief History and Present Infrastructure
One of the oldest Universities in India, the Panjab University (PU) initiated at Lahore in 1882, has a long tradition of pursuing excellence in teaching and research in science and technology, humanities, social sciences, performing arts and sports. The University supports excellence and innovation in academic programmes, promotes excellence in research, scholarship and teaching.
The University is committed to attract and support the best students and faculty, who excel at teaching and research. In independent India, Panjab University with its Campus at Chandigarh and nearly 202 affiliated colleges in Punjab state and Chandigarh U.T., has served various societal needs with distinction. The glorious traditions of the University established during the period of more than 140 years of its long service to the nation since its inception are a source of inspiration for the present generation of faculty members and students. By virtue of its history, experience, achievements and philosophy, the Panjab University has a national character and it enjoys an international stature drawing both faculty and students from all over the country and different parts of the globe. Its faculty includes some of the most distinguished scientists and academicians. It continues to attract celebrated scholars at the campus. Over the years, the reputation of the Panjab University has grown to emerge as an institution at the pinnacle in innovative teaching, research and community outreach.
In  Chandigarh, the newly built capital of Punjab, a beautiful  red sandstone campus was designed for the Panjab University by Pierre Jeanneret under the general guidance of Le Corbusier. Panjab University moved here during 1958-1960. Till the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the University had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla and Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were located in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. With the re-organization of Punjab, the University became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organized States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Gradually, the colleges of Himachal and Haryana were affiliated to the Universities in the respective states and the Panjab University was left with the affiliated colleges in the Union Territory of Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab. The Panjab University Campus at Chandigarh accommodates seventy four teaching and research departments/institutes/centres besides six independent Chairs for research. Furthermore, the university has 202 affiliated and 6 Constituent Colleges spread over Punjab and Chandigarh besides Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Kauni. In addition, there is the Vishveshavaranand Vishwa Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies at Hoshiarpur.
The Campus
Panjab University is located in Sector 14 and Sector 25 of Chandigarh, spreading across an area of almost 550 acres.
The layout of two campuses of the University has been conceived to meet the academic, administrative, sports/recreational, residential and other requirements of a growing
University. To make it self-contained, infrastructural facilities like its own Shopping Centre, Health Centre, Bank, Post office, Swimming Pool, Gymnasium, Sports Grounds, Botanical Gardens, well maintained parks, Open Air Theatre, Guest Houses, Faculty House, Seminar Complexes, Alumni House, Community Centre and a school, have been provided. Besides these facilities, the University Campus has 8 hostels for boys, 10 hostels for girls, a Working Women Hostel and International Hostel and 2 sports hostels.
A cluster of prominent buildings like the Gandhi Bhawan, the Fine Arts Museum, the University Library and the Student Centre form the hub of social interaction. The three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan, considered the pride of the University, is its most artistic building. The Fine Arts Museum, with its series of small galleries arranged around a courtyard, each gallery having a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (umbrella shaped), is not only an architectural but a structural marvel as well. The University Library, another key building, in the Sector 14 Campus is an RCC framed structure with red sandstone veneers. The Student Centre, with its circular base and a ramp pulsating around its cylindrical body, is another landmark building.
Teaching Departments/Centres
The academic institutes on the campus and  four Regional Centres are grouped under the Faculties of Arts, Science, Languages, Law, Education and Fine Arts, Business Management and Commerce, Engineering and Technology, Medical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Dairying, Animal Husbandry and Agriculture.

Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

Project
'Robust Automatic Segregation of Defective Fasteners in Industries using Deep Learning' executed in
collaboration with Nottingham Trent University
. The objective of the project was to design an autonomous system using deep learning techniques for the efficient classification of defective and non-defective fasteners in small and medium-scale industries, aiming to replace traditional manual methods that are often time-consuming and inefficient. The process begins with the collection of a diverse dataset of fastener images under consistent conditions, followed by preprocessing steps such as labelling, resizing, and augmentation to prepare the data for training. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then developed and trained to accurately classify the fasteners based on visual defects. Once the model is validated, it is integrated with an embedded system equipped with a camera for real-time image capture and analysis.
Professor Renu Vig is the Inventor for patent entitled 'Distress Signal Based Criminal Activity Detecting, Preventing and Reporting Device, System and Method' and Panjab University is the patentee. This intelligent system is capable of detecting distress voices or panic screams automatically without the need of a specific trigger word or manual activation. Upon detecting a distress signal, the device can immediately alert the nearest police station and sound an ultrasonic alarm at the location to confuse the attacker.
Professor Renu Vig has spearheaded several key initiatives in Panjab University dealing with various crucial aspects as given below.
NAAC Accreditation
:
She played a pivotal role in securing the prestigious NAAC A++ grade with a score of 3.68, the highest in the university's history. Under her leadership, the university implemented strategic improvements across all seven NAAC assessment parameters, including curricular enhancements, research innovation, and infrastructure upgrades. She ensured meticulous preparation for the NAAC peer team visit, with mock drills, campus revamps, and a comprehensive Self-Study Report (SSR).
Her collaborative approach—engaging faculty, staff, and stakeholders—and her focus on addressing past NAAC feedback were instrumental in this achievement, elevating Panjab University to India's elite institutions.
National Education Policy (NEP) Implementation
:
Panjab University initiated NEP implementation in the academic session 2023-24, and affiliated colleges in session 2024-25. A wide array of Skill Enhancement Courses (100 new courses) and Value Added Courses (approximately 75 courses) are now available. The first NEP batch will graduate from Panjab University in 2027 and from affiliated colleges in 2028. By July 2027, Panjab University must be prepared to offer a one-year Master's Program for students who have graduated with 4-year Honors/Research Degrees.
Strengthening Entrepreneurial Culture
:
The entrepreneurial culture is being strengthened by the Panjab University Incubation Centre. Skill-oriented courses are regularly organized by the Centre for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Currently, PU has more than 50 successful startups, and this ecosystem will be further strengthened through initiatives like Idea Hackathons, pitching for funds in presence of investors, industry and academia meets etc.
The S&T cluster, in collaboration with IIT Ropar through the Section 8 company PI-RAHI (
Panjab University, IIT Ropar - Regional Accelerator for Holistic Innovations
), has become operational. Efforts are being made to develop technologies and subsequently commercialize them in various areas such as medical devices, green energy, AI and Machine Learning, waste management, healthcare, agriculture etc. Institutions and organizations in the northern region are being encouraged to find solutions for industry and society.
Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security
:
The establishment of a Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Cyber Security, in collaboration with the Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC), an international cyber security non-profit foundation, is envisaged. An MoU has already been signed with ISAC for capacity building in Cyber Security.
Digital Transformation through e-SAMARTH Deployment
:
Under her visionary leadership, Panjab University has adopted the e-SAMARTH ERP system, a cloud-based platform launched by the Ministry of Education under the National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT). This initiative aims to consolidate fragmented data across colleges/departments into a unified digital framework, enhancing transparency and efficiency.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Research & Development Cell
About Research & Development Cell
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages the promotion of quality research within the Higher Education system. Research and innovation are important aspects to enhance quality education by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Societal challenges of our country can only be addressed by having a strong and vibrant higher education ecosystem with an emphasis on research, innovation, and technology development. The integration of Research, Innovation and Technology Development is the foundation of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India). The establishment of Research and Development Cell (RDC) in Panjab University, Chandigarh is aimed at enabling the attainment of targets of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat and is expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing multidisciplinary/ transdisciplinary and translational research culture mandated in NEP 2020.
Vision
To  put in place a robust mechanism for developing and strengthening the research ecosystem within the University in consonance with the provisions of NEP-2020.
Mission
To create a congenial ecosystem environment for enhanced research productivity.
To promote collaboration across industry, government, community- based organizations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels.
To facilitate greater access to research through optimum utilization and mobilization of existing resources and funding.
Objectives
To build an organizational/ intra-institutional structure with role-based functions of RDC, formulate Research Policy for the University, identify thrust areas of research, and form related cluster groups/ frontline teams/consortia of researchers.
To help the University create Research Policies for recruitment of research personnel, procurement of equipment, and financial management with sufficient autonomy to the Principal Investigator(s) and propagate research outcomes to stakeholders and the public at large.
To put in place policies to promote researchers and innovators, identify potential collaborators from industry, research organizations, academic institutions & other stakeholders for cooperation and synergistic partnerships.
To act as a mediator between researchers & relevant research funding agencies, provide guidance in preparation & submission of project proposals and post-sanctioning of the grants to supervise adherence to timelines.
To create mechanism for coordination among other cells/centers dealing with University-Industry Inter Linkage, Incubation, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions
The establishment of the RDC would facilitate the creation of a research ecosystem for impactful and sustained research output. The essential elements of such an ecosystem, viz., generation of knowledge and facilitation of research, innovation and technology development for industrial & societal benefits, are addressed by human resource (researcher & faculty), intellectual capital (knowledge & skills), governance (regulation & policies) and financial resources (funding & grants).

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

Profile of Panjab University
Brief History and Present Infrastructure
One of the oldest Universities in India, the Panjab University (PU) initiated at Lahore in 1882, has a long tradition of pursuing excellence in teaching and research in science and technology, humanities, social sciences, performing arts and sports. The University supports excellence and innovation in academic programmes, promotes excellence in research, scholarship and teaching.
The University is committed to attract and support the best students and faculty, who excel at teaching and research. In independent India, Panjab University with its Campus at Chandigarh and nearly 202 affiliated colleges in Punjab state and Chandigarh U.T., has served various societal needs with distinction. The glorious traditions of the University established during the period of more than 140 years of its long service to the nation since its inception are a source of inspiration for the present generation of faculty members and students. By virtue of its history, experience, achievements and philosophy, the Panjab University has a national character and it enjoys an international stature drawing both faculty and students from all over the country and different parts of the globe. Its faculty includes some of the most distinguished scientists and academicians. It continues to attract celebrated scholars at the campus. Over the years, the reputation of the Panjab University has grown to emerge as an institution at the pinnacle in innovative teaching, research and community outreach.
In  Chandigarh, the newly built capital of Punjab, a beautiful  red sandstone campus was designed for the Panjab University by Pierre Jeanneret under the general guidance of Le Corbusier. Panjab University moved here during 1958-1960. Till the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the University had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla and Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were located in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. With the re-organization of Punjab, the University became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organized States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Gradually, the colleges of Himachal and Haryana were affiliated to the Universities in the respective states and the Panjab University was left with the affiliated colleges in the Union Territory of Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab. The Panjab University Campus at Chandigarh accommodates seventy four teaching and research departments/institutes/centres besides six independent Chairs for research. Furthermore, the university has 202 affiliated and 6 Constituent Colleges spread over Punjab and Chandigarh besides Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Kauni. In addition, there is the Vishveshavaranand Vishwa Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies at Hoshiarpur.
The Campus
Panjab University is located in Sector 14 and Sector 25 of Chandigarh, spreading across an area of almost 550 acres.
The layout of two campuses of the University has been conceived to meet the academic, administrative, sports/recreational, residential and other requirements of a growing
University. To make it self-contained, infrastructural facilities like its own Shopping Centre, Health Centre, Bank, Post office, Swimming Pool, Gymnasium, Sports Grounds, Botanical Gardens, well maintained parks, Open Air Theatre, Guest Houses, Faculty House, Seminar Complexes, Alumni House, Community Centre and a school, have been provided. Besides these facilities, the University Campus has 8 hostels for boys, 10 hostels for girls, a Working Women Hostel and International Hostel and 2 sports hostels.
A cluster of prominent buildings like the Gandhi Bhawan, the Fine Arts Museum, the University Library and the Student Centre form the hub of social interaction. The three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan, considered the pride of the University, is its most artistic building. The Fine Arts Museum, with its series of small galleries arranged around a courtyard, each gallery having a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (umbrella shaped), is not only an architectural but a structural marvel as well. The University Library, another key building, in the Sector 14 Campus is an RCC framed structure with red sandstone veneers. The Student Centre, with its circular base and a ramp pulsating around its cylindrical body, is another landmark building.
Teaching Departments/Centres
The academic institutes on the campus and  four Regional Centres are grouped under the Faculties of Arts, Science, Languages, Law, Education and Fine Arts, Business Management and Commerce, Engineering and Technology, Medical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Dairying, Animal Husbandry and Agriculture. Most of the departments have their own specialized libraries, and the working period runs for at least 180 days in a year.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Panjab University, being public authority as defined in Section 2(h) and in pursuance of provisions of Section 4(1)(b) of Right to Information Act, 2005, hereby makes available the information under the prescribed Manuals, through its Website to enable the citizens to access the information under the control of the University, so as to promote transparency and accountability in the working of such authority.
It is hoped that the information put under the public domain through Panjab University Website would facilitate the citizens to access information through electronic mode, thereby avoiding, to the extent possible, inconvenience to ask formally for such information as may be already open to them. While compiling the information due care has been exercised. However, if any mistake has crept into due to inadvertence, it is subject to correction.

Panjab University Oral History Project

Panjab University Oral History Project
OHP Administrator
2016-10-01T20:41:20+05:30
Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

Students of CDOE undertake the same syllabi, in the same duration and appear in the same mode of examination like the regular students of Departments and Colleges affiliated to Panjab University.

Research & Development Cell
About Research & Development Cell
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages the promotion of quality research within the Higher Education system. Research and innovation are important aspects to enhance quality education by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Societal challenges of our country can only be addressed by having a strong and vibrant higher education ecosystem with an emphasis on research, innovation, and technology development. The integration of Research, Innovation and Technology Development is the foundation of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India). The establishment of Research and Development Cell (RDC) in Panjab University, Chandigarh is aimed at enabling the attainment of targets of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat and is expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing multidisciplinary/ transdisciplinary and translational research culture mandated in NEP 2020.
Vision
To  put in place a robust mechanism for developing and strengthening the research ecosystem within the University in consonance with the provisions of NEP-2020.
Mission
To create a congenial ecosystem environment for enhanced research productivity.
To promote collaboration across industry, government, community- based organizations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels.
To facilitate greater access to research through optimum utilization and mobilization of existing resources and funding.
Objectives
To build an organizational/ intra-institutional structure with role-based functions of RDC, formulate Research Policy for the University, identify thrust areas of research, and form related cluster groups/ frontline teams/consortia of researchers.
To help the University create Research Policies for recruitment of research personnel, procurement of equipment, and financial management with sufficient autonomy to the Principal Investigator(s) and propagate research outcomes to stakeholders and the public at large.
To put in place policies to promote researchers and innovators, identify potential collaborators from industry, research organizations, academic institutions & other stakeholders for cooperation and synergistic partnerships.
To act as a mediator between researchers & relevant research funding agencies, provide guidance in preparation & submission of project proposals and post-sanctioning of the grants to supervise adherence to timelines.
To create mechanism for coordination among other cells/centers dealing with University-Industry Inter Linkage, Incubation, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions
The establishment of the RDC would facilitate the creation of a research ecosystem for impactful and sustained research output. The essential elements of such an ecosystem, viz., generation of knowledge and facilitation of research, innovation and technology development for industrial & societal benefits, are addressed by human resource (researcher & faculty), intellectual capital (knowledge & skills), governance (regulation & policies) and financial resources (funding & grants).

National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was approved by the MHRD and launched by Honourable Minister of Human Resource Development on 29th September 2015.
This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

Profile of Panjab University
Brief History and Present Infrastructure
One of the oldest Universities in India, the Panjab University (PU) initiated at Lahore in 1882, has a long tradition of pursuing excellence in teaching and research in science and technology, humanities, social sciences, performing arts and sports. The University supports excellence and innovation in academic programmes, promotes excellence in research, scholarship and teaching.
The University is committed to attract and support the best students and faculty, who excel at teaching and research. In independent India, Panjab University with its Campus at Chandigarh and nearly 202 affiliated colleges in Punjab state and Chandigarh U.T., has served various societal needs with distinction. The glorious traditions of the University established during the period of more than 140 years of its long service to the nation since its inception are a source of inspiration for the present generation of faculty members and students. By virtue of its history, experience, achievements and philosophy, the Panjab University has a national character and it enjoys an international stature drawing both faculty and students from all over the country and different parts of the globe. Its faculty includes some of the most distinguished scientists and academicians. It continues to attract celebrated scholars at the campus. Over the years, the reputation of the Panjab University has grown to emerge as an institution at the pinnacle in innovative teaching, research and community outreach.
In  Chandigarh, the newly built capital of Punjab, a beautiful  red sandstone campus was designed for the Panjab University by Pierre Jeanneret under the general guidance of Le Corbusier. Panjab University moved here during 1958-1960. Till the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the University had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla and Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were located in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. With the re-organization of Punjab, the University became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organized States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Gradually, the colleges of Himachal and Haryana were affiliated to the Universities in the respective states and the Panjab University was left with the affiliated colleges in the Union Territory of Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab. The Panjab University Campus at Chandigarh accommodates seventy four teaching and research departments/institutes/centres besides six independent Chairs for research. Furthermore, the university has 202 affiliated and 6 Constituent Colleges spread over Punjab and Chandigarh besides Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Kauni. In addition, there is the Vishveshavaranand Vishwa Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies at Hoshiarpur.
The Campus
Panjab University is located in Sector 14 and Sector 25 of Chandigarh, spreading across an area of almost 550 acres.
The layout of two campuses of the University has been conceived to meet the academic, administrative, sports/recreational, residential and other requirements of a growing
University. To make it self-contained, infrastructural facilities like its own Shopping Centre, Health Centre, Bank, Post office, Swimming Pool, Gymnasium, Sports Grounds, Botanical Gardens, well maintained parks, Open Air Theatre, Guest Houses, Faculty House, Seminar Complexes, Alumni House, Community Centre and a school, have been provided. Besides these facilities, the University Campus has 8 hostels for boys, 10 hostels for girls, a Working Women Hostel and International Hostel and 2 sports hostels.
A cluster of prominent buildings like the Gandhi Bhawan, the Fine Arts Museum, the University Library and the Student Centre form the hub of social interaction. The three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan, considered the pride of the University, is its most artistic building. The Fine Arts Museum, with its series of small galleries arranged around a courtyard, each gallery having a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (umbrella shaped), is not only an architectural but a structural marvel as well. The University Library, another key building, in the Sector 14 Campus is an RCC framed structure with red sandstone veneers. The Student Centre, with its circular base and a ramp pulsating around its cylindrical body, is another landmark building.
Teaching Departments/Centres
The academic institutes on the campus and  four Regional Centres are grouped under the Faculties of Arts, Science, Languages, Law, Education and Fine Arts, Business Management and Commerce, Engineering and Technology, Medical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Dairying, Animal Husbandry and Agriculture.

Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was approved by the MHRD and launched by Honourable Minister of Human Resource Development on 29th September 2015.
This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
India Rankings – 2016 based on this framework were released on 4th April 2016.
For India Rankings – 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. However, there are a few significant changes in a few sub-parameters. Also, this year every large institution will be given a common overall rank as well as a discipline specific rank as applicable.
Details are in the Ranking Document available at

Vice Chancellor
Professor Renu Vig
Vice Chancellor Panjab University
Professor (Dr.) Renu Vig is discharging the responsibilities of Vice-Chancellor of Panjab University since Jan 16, 2023. Prior to this, she has held several key positions at Panjab University-Dean University Instruction, Dean Research, Dean Faculty of Engineering & Technology, and Director UIET. With a teaching and research experience of more than 35 years, Professor Renu Vig holds a Ph.D. in Engineering and Technology in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.
She has a stellar academic record having been awarded Gold Medal by Panjab University for standing first in B.E. across all departments in Punjab Engineering College and other affiliated colleges, and Roll of Honour for standing third in Pre-Engineering, Panjab University. In addition to academics and research, the exemplary contribution she made during sabbatical project undertaken at Infosys Technologies Ltd earned her appreciation letter from Dr. M.P. Ravindra, Vice President and Head, Education & Research Dept., Infosys Technologies Ltd.
She has guided 10 PhD successfully in the area of Signal Processing and Fuzzy Logic based control. She has more than 100 SCI/Scopus indexed reputed research publications to her credit. She has visited prestigious institutions such as University of Cambridge, University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham and National University of Singapore. She has presented paper in World Congress on Engineering at Imperial College London.
Professor Renu Vig has significant experience of conceiving projects for arranging grants from various agencies. Under her leadership, UIET received Rs. 10 crore grant under TEQIP-II project of MHRD for sub Component 1.1 i.e. Strengthening Institutions to improve Learning outcomes and Employability of Graduates. UIET was selected as a well performing institute, and additional Grant of Rs. 5 crore was sanctioned by MHRD. She successfully set up Design Innovation Centre funded by MHRD at Panjab University. This project was worth Rs. 10 Crore and initiatives are being taken to promote design and innovation culture among students and faculty.
Professor Renu Vig is Principal Investigator of
Project
'Robust Automatic Segregation of Defective Fasteners in Industries using Deep Learning' executed in
collaboration with Nottingham Trent University
. The objective of the project was to design an autonomous system using deep learning techniques for the efficient classification of defective and non-defective fasteners in small and medium-scale industries, aiming to replace traditional manual methods that are often time-consuming and inefficient. The process begins with the collection of a diverse dataset of fastener images under consistent conditions, followed by preprocessing steps such as labelling, resizing, and augmentation to prepare the data for training. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then developed and trained to accurately classify the fasteners based on visual defects. Once the model is validated, it is integrated with an embedded system equipped with a camera for real-time image capture and analysis.
Professor Renu Vig is the Inventor for patent entitled 'Distress Signal Based Criminal Activity Detecting, Preventing and Reporting Device, System and Method' and Panjab University is the patentee. This intelligent system is capable of detecting distress voices or panic screams automatically without the need of a specific trigger word or manual activation. Upon detecting a distress signal, the device can immediately alert the nearest police station and sound an ultrasonic alarm at the location to confuse the attacker.
Professor Renu Vig has spearheaded several key initiatives in Panjab University dealing with various crucial aspects as given below.
NAAC Accreditation
:
She played a pivotal role in securing the prestigious NAAC A++ grade with a score of 3.68, the highest in the university's history. Under her leadership, the university implemented strategic improvements across all seven NAAC assessment parameters, including curricular enhancements, research innovation, and infrastructure upgrades. She ensured meticulous preparation for the NAAC peer team visit, with mock drills, campus revamps, and a comprehensive Self-Study Report (SSR).
Her collaborative approach—engaging faculty, staff, and stakeholders—and her focus on addressing past NAAC feedback were instrumental in this achievement, elevating Panjab University to India's elite institutions.
National Education Policy (NEP) Implementation
:
Panjab University initiated NEP implementation in the academic session 2023-24, and affiliated colleges in session 2024-25. A wide array of Skill Enhancement Courses (100 new courses) and Value Added Courses (approximately 75 courses) are now available. The first NEP batch will graduate from Panjab University in 2027 and from affiliated colleges in 2028. By July 2027, Panjab University must be prepared to offer a one-year Master's Program for students who have graduated with 4-year Honors/Research Degrees.
Strengthening Entrepreneurial Culture
:
The entrepreneurial culture is being strengthened by the Panjab University Incubation Centre. Skill-oriented courses are regularly organized by the Centre for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Currently, PU has more than 50 successful startups, and this ecosystem will be further strengthened through initiatives like Idea Hackathons, pitching for funds in presence of investors, industry and academia meets etc.
The S&T cluster, in collaboration with IIT Ropar through the Section 8 company PI-RAHI (
Panjab University, IIT Ropar - Regional Accelerator for Holistic Innovations
), has become operational. Efforts are being made to develop technologies and subsequently commercialize them in various areas such as medical devices, green energy, AI and Machine Learning, waste management, healthcare, agriculture etc. Institutions and organizations in the northern region are being encouraged to find solutions for industry and society.
Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security
:
The establishment of a Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Cyber Security, in collaboration with the Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC), an international cyber security non-profit foundation, is envisaged. An MoU has already been signed with ISAC for capacity building in Cyber Security.
Digital Transformation through e-SAMARTH Deployment
:
Under her visionary leadership, Panjab University has adopted the e-SAMARTH ERP system, a cloud-based platform launched by the Ministry of Education under the National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT). This initiative aims to consolidate fragmented data across colleges/departments into a unified digital framework, enhancing transparency and efficiency.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.
