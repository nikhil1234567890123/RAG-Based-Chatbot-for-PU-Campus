About National Cadet Corps
The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is a Voluntary Organisation, which is administered through the Ministry of Defence. NCC is the largest uniformed youth organization. Its motto is 'Unity and Discipline'. In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation.
In India, The NCC was formed under the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It can be traced back to the ""University Corps"", which was created under the Indian Defense Act 1917, with the objective to make up for the shortage in the Army. The National Cadet Corps is the youth wing of Armed Forces with its Headquarters at New Delhi, Delhi, India. It is open to school and college students on a voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Army, Navy and Air Wing, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens.

Further, it aims at creating a pool of organized, trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities in all walks of life, who will serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless to say, the NCC also provides an environment conducive to motivating young Indians to join the armed forces.

About Research & Development Cell
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages the promotion of quality research within the Higher Education system. Research and innovation are important aspects to enhance quality education by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Societal challenges of our country can only be addressed by having a strong and vibrant higher education ecosystem with an emphasis on research, innovation, and technology development. The integration of Research, Innovation and Technology Development is the foundation of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India). The establishment of Research and Development Cell (RDC) in Panjab University, Chandigarh is aimed at enabling the attainment of targets of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat and is expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing multidisciplinary/ transdisciplinary and translational research culture mandated in NEP 2020.

Mission
To create a congenial ecosystem environment for enhanced research productivity.
To promote collaboration across industry, government, community- based organizations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels.
To facilitate greater access to research through optimum utilization and mobilization of existing resources and funding.
Objectives
To build an organizational/ intra-institutional structure with role-based functions of RDC, formulate Research Policy for the University, identify thrust areas of research, and form related cluster groups/ frontline teams/consortia of researchers.
To help the University create Research Policies for recruitment of research personnel, procurement of equipment, and financial management with sufficient autonomy to the Principal Investigator(s) and propagate research outcomes to stakeholders and the public at large.

To act as a mediator between researchers & relevant research funding agencies, provide guidance in preparation & submission of project proposals and post-sanctioning of the grants to supervise adherence to timelines.
To create mechanism for coordination among other cells/centers dealing with University-Industry Inter Linkage, Incubation, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions
The establishment of the RDC would facilitate the creation of a research ecosystem for impactful and sustained research output. The essential elements of such an ecosystem, viz., generation of knowledge and facilitation of research, innovation and technology development for industrial & societal benefits, are addressed by human resource (researcher & faculty), intellectual capital (knowledge & skills), governance (regulation & policies) and financial resources (funding & grants).

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

My Hoshiarpur Days
Panjab University Oral History Project
Panjab University Oral History Project
Panjab University Oral History Project
OHP Administrator
2016-10-01T20:41:20+05:30
Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee University’s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.
The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.

Panjab University Hostels
About Panjab University Hostels
A hostel is a home away from home. Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation.
There are twenty one Residence Halls for students on the campus, 8 for boys, 11 for girls, one Working Women Hostel and an International Hostel. These Halls, which accommodate approximately 7600 students, are named after eminent men and women, historical personalities and personages: Mehar Chand Mahajan, G.C. Chatterji, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Justice Teja Singh Samundari, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Mata Gujri, Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mata Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Bebe Nanki, Florence Nightingale, Amrita Pritam, Neerja Bhanot, Girls Hostel No.11, Sushila Nayyar and Sarvdaman Chowla who played an important role in shaping the destiny of world and left footprints on the sands of time.
The University Hostels take pains to give their students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Each hostel has a dining hall, canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors’ lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. The Common Room is fairly well equipped with current magazines and newspapers. There is provision for indoor games, LED TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi has been provided in each hostel.
Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fans, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
Comforts are important but they alone are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colorful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
There is no doubt that during these formative years in the hostel, life-long bonds are created and friendships cemented. This is a time, which will stand out in the memory as a golden period. University experience is an important milestone in an individual’s life, the stepping-stone to an adult life of responsibility and care. The hostels of Panjab University try to provide an ideal atmosphere for a healthy, all round development of personality and a launch pad for a glorious career ahead.
Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.

National Cadet Corps
About National Cadet Corps
The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is a Voluntary Organisation, which is administered through the Ministry of Defence. NCC is the largest uniformed youth organization. Its motto is 'Unity and Discipline'. In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation.
In India, The NCC was formed under the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It can be traced back to the ""University Corps"", which was created under the Indian Defense Act 1917, with the objective to make up for the shortage in the Army. The National Cadet Corps is the youth wing of Armed Forces with its Headquarters at New Delhi, Delhi, India. It is open to school and college students on a voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Army, Navy and Air Wing, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens.
Panjab University has taken a lead and started the ""National Cadet Corps Company"" for Boys under the 2nd Chandigarh NCC boys Battalion and for Girls under 1st Chandigarh NCC Girls Battalion.
University offers 'B' and 'C' certificates for Senior Division/Senior wing (SD/SW) cadets. Initially students from various departments of university were enrolled for NCC on merit for three years. The University has an NCC Office and parade ground for cadets.
AIMS OF NCC

The NCC aims at developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens. Further, it aims at creating a pool of organized, trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities in all walks of life, who will serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless to say, the NCC also provides an environment conducive to motivating young Indians to join the armed forces.
To Create a Human Resource of Organized, Trained and Motivated Youth, To Provide Leadership in all Walks of life and be Always Available for the Service of the Nation.
To Provide a Suitable Environment to Motivate the Youth to Take Up a Career in the Armed Forces.

To develop an Institutional Research Information System through IQAC for sharing the status of ongoing/ completed research projects/Programmes, expertise & resources, etc., making effective use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for preparing the database of in-house experts to provide industrial consultancy and services.
To engage & optimally utilize the services of superannuated active faculty/scientists in research capacity building of talented young minds and promote mobility of researchers across institutions and R&D Labs.
To serve as nodal center for ideation and conceptualization of research topics/themes, across the disciplines, by organizing workshops and training programs and ensuring the integrity and ethical practices in research activities including clearance of ethical committee wherever and whenever needed.
Functions

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.

National Education Policy
About National Education Policy
The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientific and technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilled workforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will be increasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics and pandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management and development of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinary learning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming a developed country as well as among the three largest economies in the world. Indeed, with the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable. The curriculum must include basic arts, crafts, humanities, games, sports and fitness, languages, literature, culture, and values, in addition to science and mathematics, to develop all aspects and capabilities of learners; and make education more well-rounded, useful, and fulfilling to the learner. Education must build character, enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate, and caring, while at the same time prepare them for gainful, fulfilling employment. The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system.
Panjab University is implementing the National Education Policy in a phased manner. The Senate has approved the implementation of the UGC NEP Guidelines based Curriculum and Credit Framework for the  Four Year Undergraduate Programmes with Multiple Entry Multiple Exit. The Regulations and Syllabi  for the session 2023-2024 have been approved.
